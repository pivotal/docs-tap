# Scan samples for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This section provides samples on multiple use cases for SCST - Scan that you can copy to your cluster for testing purposes.

> **Note** This topic uses SCST - Scan 1.0. SCST - Scan 1.0 is deprecated in
Tanzu Application Platform v1.9 and later. In Tanzu Application Platform v1.9, SCST - Scan 1.0 is
still the default in Supply Chain with Testing. For more information, see [Add testing and scanning to your application](../getting-started/add-test-and-security.hbs.md#add-testing-and-scanning-to-your-application).
VMware recommends using SCST - Scan 2.0 as SCST - Scan 1.0 will be removed in a future version and
SCST - Scan 2.0 will be the default. For more information, see [SCST - Scan versions](./overview.hbs.md).
