# Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

## Overview
With Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan, Tanzu customers can build and deploy secure, trusted software that complies with their corporate security requirements. To enable this, Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan provides scanning and gatekeeping capabilities that Application and DevSecOps teams can easily incorporate earlier in their path to production as it is a known industry best practice for reducing security risk and ensuring more efficient remediation.

## Use cases
* Using your scanner as a plug-in, scan source code repositories and images for known CVEs before deploying to a cluster.
* Identify CVEs by continuously scanning each new code commit and/or each new image built.
* Analyze scan results against user-defined policies using Open Policy Agent.
* Produce vulnerability scan results and post them to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store from where they can be queried.

## Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan features
The following Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan features make the use cases available:

* Built Kubernetes controllers to run scan jobs.  
* Built Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Image and Source Scan.  
* Created a CRD for a scanner plugin. Provided example using: Anchore's Syft and Grype.
