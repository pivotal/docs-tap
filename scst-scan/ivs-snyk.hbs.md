# Configure an ImageVulnerabilityScan for Snyk

This topic tells you how to configure an ImageVulnerabilityScan for Snyk. 

Use the following ImageVulnerabilityScan and secret configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: snyk-token
stringData:
  snyk: |
    {"api": "SNYK-API-TOKEN"}
---
apiVersion: app-scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ImageVulnerabilityScan
metadata:
  name: snyk-ivs
spec:
  image: nginx@sha256:... # The image to be scanned. Digest must be specified.
  scanResults:
    location: registry/project/scan-results
  serviceAccountNames:
    publisher: publisher
    scanner: scanner
  workspace:
    bindings:
    - name: snyk
      secret:
        secretName: snyk-token
        items:
          - key: snyk
            path: configstore/snyk.json
  steps:
  - name: snyk
    image: SNYK-SCANNER-IMAGE
    env:
    - name: XDG_CONFIG_HOME
      value: /snyk
    command: ["snyk","container","test",$(params.image),"--json-file-output=scan.json"]
    onError: continue
  - name: snyk2spdx # You will need to create your own image. See explanation below.
    image: SNYK2SPDX-IMAGE
    command:
    ....
```

Where:

- `SNYK-API-TOKEN` is your Snyk API Token obtained from the [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/authenticate-the-cli-with-your-account).
- `SNYK-SCANNER-IMAGE` is the Snyk Scanner image used to run Snyk scans. See [Snyk documentation](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images) for Snyk images.
- `SNYK2SPDX-IMAGE` is the image used to convert the Snyk CLI output `scan.json` in the `snyk` step to SPDX format and have its missing `DOCUMENT DESCRIBES` relation inserted. See the Snyk [snyk2spdx repository](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk2spdx).

> **Note** After detecting vulnerabilities, the Snyk image exits with Exit Code 1 and causes a failed scan task. You can ignore the step error by setting [onError](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#specifying-onerror-for-a-step) and handling the error in a subsequent step.

For information about setting up scanner credentials, see the [Snyk CLI documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/config).
