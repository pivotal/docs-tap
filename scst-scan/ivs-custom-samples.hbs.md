# Configure your custom ImageVulnerabilityScan samples for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic gives you a sample ImageVulnerabilityScans for various scanners, and any associated secrets.

## <a id="overview"></a> ImageVulnerabilityScan samples

This section includes ImageVulnerabilityScans (IVS) for various scanners. To use them, copy the YAML content and use the following sections:

- [Carbon Black](./ivs-carbon-black.hbs.md)
- [Snyk](./ivs-snyk.hbs.md)
- [Prisma](./ivs-prisma.hbs.md)
- [Trivy](./ivs-trivy.hbs.md)
- [Grype](./ivs-grype.hbs.md)

### <a id="use-samples"></a> Use custom ImageVulnerabilityScan samples

To use a custom ImageVulnerabilityScan sample:

1. Copy the sample YAML into a file named `custom-ivs.yaml`. Some scanners, such as Carbon Black, Snyk, and Prisma Scanner, require specific credentials that you must specifiy in the secret.
2. Obtain the one or more necessary images. For example, an image containing the scanner.
3. Edit these fields of your ImageVulnerabilityScan:

   - `spec.image` is the image that you are scanning. See [Retrieving an image digest](./ivs-custom-samples.hbs.md#retrieving-an-image-digest).
   - `scanResults.location` is the registry URL where results are uploaded. For example, `my.registry/scan-results`.
   - `serviceAccountNames` includes:
     - `scanner` is the service account that runs the scan. It must have read access to `image`.
     - `publisher` is the service account that uploads results. It must have write access to `scanResults.location`.
4. Complete any scanner specific changes specified on the sample ImageVulnerabilityScan page.
5. You can either incorporate your custom ImageVulnerabilityScan into a [ClusterImageTemplate](./clusterimagetemplates.hbs.md) or run a standalone scan using:

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f custom-ivs.yaml -n DEV-NAMESPACE
  ```

  Where `DEV-NAMESPACE` is the name of the developer namespace where scanning occurs.

### <a id="retrieve-digest"></a> Retrieving an image digest

SCST - Scan 2.0 custom resources require the digest form of the URL. For example,  `nginx@sha256:aa0afebbb3cfa473099a62c4b32e9b3fb73ed23f2a75a65ce1d4b4f55a5c2ef2`.

Use the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to pull and inspect an image digest:

```console
docker pull nginx:latest
docker inspect --format='\{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' nginx:latest
```

Alternatively, you can install [krane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/krane) to retrieve the digest without pulling the image:

```console
krane digest nginx:latest
```
