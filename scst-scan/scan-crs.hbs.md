# Configure code repositories and image artifacts for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic describes how you can configure code repositories and image artifacts for SCST - Scan.

## <a id="prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite

Both the source and image scans require you to define a `ScanTemplate`. Run `kubectl get scantemplates` for the ScanTemplates provided with the scanner installation. For information about how to reference these ScanTemplates, see [How to create a ScanTemplate](create-scan-template.md).

## <a id="deploy-scan-cr"></a>Deploy scan custom resources

The scan controller defines two custom resources to create scans:

* SourceScan
* ImageScan

### <a id="sourcescan"></a>SourceScan

The `SourceScan` custom resource helps you define and trigger a scan for a given repository. You can deploy `SourceScan` with source code existing in a public repository or a private one:

1. Create the `SourceScan` custom resource.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: SourceScan
    metadata:
      # set the name of the source scan CR
      name: sample-source-scan
    spec:
      # At least one of these fields (blob or git) must be defined.
      blob:
        # location to a file with the source code compressed (supported files: .tar.gz)
        url:
      git:
        # A multiline string defining the known hosts that are going to be used for the SSH client on the container
        knownHosts:
        # Branch, tag, or commit digest
        revision:
        # The name of the kubernetes secret containing the private SSH key information.
        sshKeySecret:
        # A string containing the repository URL.
        url:
        # The username needed to SSH connection. Default value is “git”
        username:

      # A string defining the name of an existing ScanTemplate custom resource. 
      scanTemplate: my-scan-template

       # A string defining the name of an existing ScanPolicy custom resource. See "Enforcement Policies (OPA)" section.
      scanPolicy: my-scan-policy
    ```

1. Deploy the `SourceScan` custom resource to the desired namespace on cluster by running:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f <path_to_the_cr>/<custom_resource_filename>.yaml -n <desired_namespace>
    ```

    After the scanning completes, the following fields appear in the custom resource and are filled by the scanner:

    ```console
    # These fields are populated from the source scan results
    status:
      # The source code information as provided in the CycloneDX `bom>metadata>component>*` fields
      artifact:
        blob:
          url:
        git:
          url:
          revision:

      # An array populated with information about the scanning status
      # and the policy validation. These conditions might change in the lifecycle
      # of the scan, refer to the "View Scan Status and Understanding Conditions" section to learn more.
      conditions: []

      # The URL of the vulnerability scan results in the Metadata Store integration.
      # Only available when the integration is configured.
      metadataUrl:

      # When the CRD is updated to point at new revisions, this lets you know
      # if the status reflects the latest one or not
      observedGeneration: 1
      observedPolicyGeneration: 1
      observedTemplateGeneration: 1

      # The latest datetime when the scanning was successfully finished.
      scannedAt:
      # Information about the scanner that was used for the latest image scan.
      # This information reflects what's in the CycloneDX `bom>metadata>tools>tool>*` fields.
      scannedBy:
        scanner:
          # The name of the scanner that was used.
          name: my-image-scanner

          # The name of the scanner's development company or team
          vendor: my-image-scanner-provider

          # The version of the scanner used.
          version: 1.0.0
    ```

### <a id="imagescan"></a>ImageScan

The `ImageScan` custom resource helps you define and trigger a scan for a given image. You can deploy `ImageScan` with an image existing in a public or private registry:

1. Create the `ImageScan` custom resource.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ImageScan
    metadata:
      # set the name of the image scan CR
      name: sample-image-scan
    spec:
      registry:
        # Required. A string containing the image name can additionally add its tag or its digest
        image: nginx:1.16

        # A string containing the secret needed to pull the image from a private registry.
        # The secret needs to be deployed in the same namespace as the ImageScan
        imagePullSecret: my-image-pull-secret

      # A string defining the name of an existing ScanTemplate custom resource. See "How To Create a ScanTemplate" section.
      scanTemplate: my-scan-template

      # A string defining the name of an existing ScanPolicy custom resource. See "Enforcement Policies (OPA)" section.
      scanPolicy: my-scan-policy
    ```

1. Deploy the `ImageScan` custom resource to the desired namespace on cluster by running:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f <path_to_the_cr>/<custom_resource_filename>.yaml -n <desired_namespace>
    ```

    After the scanning completes, the following fields appear in the custom resource and are filled by the scanner:

    ```yaml
     # These fields are populated from the image scan results
    status:
      artifact:
        registry:
          # The image name with its digest as provided in the CycloneDX `bom>metadata>component>*` fields
          image:
          imagePullSecret:

      # An array that is populated with information about the scanning status
      # and the policy validation. These conditions might change in the lifecycle
      # of the scan, refer to the "View Scan Status and Understanding Conditions" section to learn more.
      conditions: []

      # The URL of the vulnerability scan results in the Metadata Store integration.
      # Only available when the integration is configured.
      metadataUrl:

      # When the CRD is updated to point at new revisions, this lets you know
      # whether the status reflects the latest one
      observedGeneration: 1
      observedPolicyGeneration: 1
      observedTemplateGeneration: 1

      # The latest datetime when the scanning was successfully finished.
      scannedAt:
      # Information about the scanner used for the latest image scan.
      # This information reflects what's in the CycloneDX `bom>metadata>tools>tool>*` fields.
      scannedBy:
        scanner:
          # The name of the scanner that was used.
          name: my-image-scanner

          # The name of the scanner's development company or team
          vendor: my-image-scanner-provider

          # The version of the scanner used.
          version: 1.0.0
    ```
