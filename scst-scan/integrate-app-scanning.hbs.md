This topic tells you how to enable Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan 2.0
and an included container image scanner for Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning.
The default configuration for Out of the Box Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning is SCST - Scan 1.0.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

SCST - Scan 2.0 includes two integrations for container image scanners:

| Container Image Scanner | Documentation | Cluster Image Template Name |  Status |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Aqua Trivy | [Link](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy) | `image-vulnerability-scan-trivy` | Recommended scanner for SCST - Scan 2.0 |
| Anchore Grype | [Link](https://github.com/anchore/grype) | `image-vulnerability-scan-grype` | Alternative to Trivy that is used in SCST - Scan 1.0 |

VMware recommends using Aqua Trivy scanner with Tanzu Application Platform for
container image scanning. If you want to remain consistent with the default scanner
in SCST - Scan 1.0, Anchore Grype is included as an open-source
alternative. Additionally, you can build an integration for additional
scanners. For more information, see  [Bring your own scanner with Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan 2.0](./bring-your-own-scanner.hbs.md).

## <a id="enable-supply-chain"></a> Enable with OOTB supply chain

To enable SCST - Scan 2.0 with an OOTB supply chain using the Trivy scanner:

1. Update your `tap-values.yaml` file to specify the Trivy `ClusterImageTemplate`. For example:

    ```yaml
    ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning:
      image_scanner_template_name: image-vulnerability-scan-trivy
    ```

1. (Optional) In Tanzu Application Platform v1.8 if you are using a vulnerability scanner other than Trivy, you must specify the registry location of the container image to use for scanning. For example,
if you are using the Grype template, set `ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning.image_scanning_cli`
to the Grype image, for example,

    ```yaml
    ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning:
      image_scanner_template_name: image-vulnerability-scan-grype
      image_scanning_cli:
        image: registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages@sha256:feb1cdbd5c918aae7a89bdb2aa39d486bf6ffc81000764b522842e5934578497
    ```

    This example uses the packaged Grype image, but you can also use images from public repositories such as `anchore/grype:latest`.

1. Update your Tanzu Application Platform installation by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v TAP-VERSION  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

    Where `TAP-VERSION` is the version of Tanzu Application Platform installed.

1. Verify the scan capability is working as expected by creating a workload. See [Verify scanning with Supply Chain integration](./verify-app-scanning-supply-chain.hbs.md).
