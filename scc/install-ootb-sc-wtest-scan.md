1. Ensure you do not have Out of The Box Supply Chain With Testing
(`ootb-supply-chain-testing.tanzu.vmware.com`) installed:

    1. Run the following command:

        ```
        tanzu package installed list --namespace tap-install
        ```

    1. Verify `ootb-supply-chain-testing` is in the output:

        ```
        NAME                                PACKAGE-NAME
        ootb-delivery-basic                 ootb-delivery-basic.tanzu.vmware.com
        ootb-supply-chain-basic             ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com
        ootb-templates                      ootb-templates.tanzu.vmware.com
        ```

    1. If you see `ootb-supply-chain-testing` in the list, uninstall it by running:

        ```
        tanzu package installed delete ootb-supply-chain-testing --namespace tap-install
        ```

        Example output:

        ```

1. With the configuration ready, install the package by running:


    ```

      --package-name ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.5.1 \
      --namespace tap-install \
      --values-file ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning-values.yaml
