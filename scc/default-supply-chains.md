# Default Supply Chains

Default supply chains are provided out of the box with Tanzu Application Platform. The two default supply chains that are included are:

- Source to URL
- Source & Test to URL
- Source & Scan to URL

Regardless of the supply chain chosen, we need to first set credentials for a
registry where Tanzu Build Service should push the images that it builds.

### Credentials for pushing app images to a registry

As the supply chain builds a container image based of the source code and
pushes it to a registry, we need to provide to the systems the credentials for
doing so.

Using the `imagepullsecret` command from the [tanzu cli] we're able to
provision a base secret that contains such credentials and then export the
contents of that secret to the namespaces where it should be consumed.


```bash
# define details about the registry that we want to create a secret
# with the credentials to be exposed to cluster components and the
# supplychain.
#
#
REGISTRY=10.188.0.3:5000
REGISTRY_USERNAME=admin
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=admin


# create a Secret object using the `dockerconfigjson` format using the
# credentials provided, then a SecretExport (`secretgen-controller`
# resource) so that it gets exported to all namespaces where a
# placeholder secret can be found.
#
#
tanzu imagepullsecret add registry-credentials \
  --export-to-all-namespaces \
  --registry $REGISTRY \
  --username $REGISTRY_USERNAME \
  --password $REGISTRY_PASSWORD
```
```console
- Adding image pull secret 'registry-credentials'...
 Added image pull secret 'registry-credentials' into namespace 'default'
```

_ps.: note that the REGISTRY here _must_ be the same as the one set in the
values file above._

## Source to URL

Source to URL is the most basic supply chain allowing you to:

- Watch a git repository
- Build the code into an image
- Apply some conventions to the K8s YAML
- Deploy the application to the same cluster

![Source to URL Supply Chain](images/source-to-url.png)


### Example usage

1. ensure that the supply chain has been installed

```bash
tanzu apps cluster-supply-chain list
```
```console
NAME              READY   AGE     LABEL SELECTOR
source-to-url     Ready   2m20s   apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type=web
```


2. setup a service account and placeholder secret for registry credentials

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: registry-credentials
  annotations:
    secretgen.carvel.dev/image-pull-secret: ""
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: e30K

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default   # must match the name configured in the supply chain
                  # installation (defaults to `default`)
secrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
```

3. create the workload

```bash
tanzu workload create ... ?
```
```console
?
```

## Source & Test to URL

The source & test to URL supply chain builds on the ability of the source to
url supply chain and adds the ability to perform testing using Tekton.

![Source Test to URL](images/source-test-to-url.png)


### Example usage

#### Developer Workload

1. ensure that the supply chain has been installed

```bash
tanzu apps cluster-supply-chain list
```
```console
NAME                 READY   AGE     LABEL SELECTOR
source-test-to-url   Ready   2m20s   apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type=web
```

2. setup a service account and placeholder secret for registry credentials

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: registry-credentials
  annotations:
    secretgen.carvel.dev/image-pull-secret: ""
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: e30K

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default   # must match the name configured in the supply chain
                  # installation (defaults to `default`)
secrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-credentials
```

2. configure a Tekton pipeline for running the tests

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: developer-defined-tekton-pipeline
spec:
  params:
    - name: source-url
    - name: source-revision
  tasks:
    - name: test
      params:
        - name: source-url
          value: $(params.source-url)
        - name: source-revision
          value: $(params.source-revision)
      taskSpec:
        params:
          - name: source-url
          - name: source-revision
        steps:
          - name: test
            image: golang
            script: |-
              cd `mktemp -d`

              wget -qO- $(params.source-url) | tar xvz
              go test -v ./...
```

## Source & Scan to URL

The source & scan to URL supply chain builds on the ability of the source to url supply chain and adds the ability to perform source and image scanning using Grype.

- Watch a git repository
- Run tests using Tekton
- Scan the code for known vulnerabilities
- Build the code into an image
- Scan the image for known vulnerabilities
- Apply some conventions to the K8s YAML
- Deploy the application to the same cluster

![Source Scan to URL](images/source-scan-to-url.png)

### Example usage

This example builds on the previous supply chain examples, so refer to them for details about those parts (Test, TBS etc) In particular, this example adds Source and Image Scanning capabilities.

#### Tanzu Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan cluster objects

The notable addition is a Scan Policy, which enables policy enforcement on Vulnerabilities found. The Scan Policy can be added with the following:

```bash
ytt --ignore-unknown-comments \
    -f ./example/scanner.yaml \
  | kapp deploy --yes -a scan-cluster-setup -f-
```

The next step would be to then submit a workload like in the other examples.
=======

3. submit a workload

```bash
tanzu apps workload create hello-world \
	--label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type=web \
  --git-branch main \
  --git-repo https://github.com/kontinue/hello-world \
  --param tekton-pipeline-name=developer-defined-tekton-pipeline
```
```console
Create workload:
      1 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      2 + |kind: Workload
      3 + |metadata:
      4 + |  name: my-workload
      5 + |  namespace: default
      6 + |spec:
      7 + |  params:
      8 + |  - name: tekton-pipeline-name
      9 + |    value: developer-defined-tekton-pipeline
     10 + |  source:
     11 + |    git:
     12 + |      ref:
     13 + |        branch: main
     14 + |      url: https://github.com/kontinue/hello-world

? Do you want to create this workload? Yes
Created workload "my-workload"
```

4. observe that we went from source code to a deployed application

```bash
kubectl get workload,gitrepository,pipelinerun,images.kpack,podintent,app,services.serving
```
```console
