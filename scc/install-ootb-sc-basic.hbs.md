    ```yaml
    registry:
      server: REGISTRY-SERVER
      repository: REGISTRY-REPOSITORY

    gitops:
      server_address: https://github.com/
      repository_owner: vmware-tanzu
      branch: main
      username: supplychain
      email: supplychain
      commit_message: supplychain@cluster.local
      ssh_secret: git-ssh
      commit_strategy: direct

    maven:
      repository:
        url: https://my-maven-repository/releases
        secret_name: my-maven-repository-credentials

    cluster_builder: default
    service_account: default
    ```

1. With the configuration ready, install the package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package install ootb-supply-chain-basic \
      --package-name ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.7.0 \
      --namespace tap-install \
      --values-file ootb-supply-chain-basic-values.yaml
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    \ Installing package 'ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com'
    | Getting package metadata for 'ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com'

    / 'PackageInstall' resource install status: Reconciling


     Added installed package 'ootb-supply-chain-basic' in namespace 'tap-install'
    ```
