# Carvel Package Supply Chains (alpha)

The [Out of the Box Basic Supply Chain](ootb-supply-chain-basic.hbs.md) package
introduces a variation of the OOTB Basic supply chains that outputs Carvel
Packages. The Carvel Package Supply Chains enable users to deliver applications
to multiple production environments with configuration for each environment.

This feature is in **alpha** and has the following limits:

1. Only the [Out of the Box Basic Supply Chain](ootb-supply-chain-basic.hbs.md) package is supported. The Testing and Scanning supply chains are not supported.
2. Only workloads of type `server` are supported.
3. Innerloop development is not supported.
4. Azure GitOps repositories are not supported.

This topic explains what the Carvel Package Supply Chains do, how they work, how
operators can enable them, and how to create a `Workload` that uses them.

## Overview of the Carvel Package Supply Chains

The traditional Out of the Box Supply Chain Basic Supply Chains outputs a
`Deliverable` object. These `Deliverable`s are deployed to a cluster by the Out
of the Box Delivery Supply Chain. The Carvel Package Supply Chains output a
Carvel `Package` object to a GitOps repository. These `Packages` have
configurable parameters such as `hostname` and `replicas` that are configured
per environment. GitOps tools such as FluxCD and ArgoCD can deploy the
`Package`s onto multiple environments.

> **Note** The underlying Kubernetes resources created for your `server`
> `Workload` are the same for `source-to-url` or `basic-image-to-url`, with the
> addition of a `networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress` resource. For example,
> `Deployment`. The Carvel `Package` wraps these resources.

### What do the Carvel Package Supply Chains Do?

There are two Carvel Package Supply Chains, `source-to-url-package` and
`basic-image-to-url-package` in the Out of the Box Supply Chain Package. They
are identical to `source-to-url` and `basic-image-to-url`, except for three
resources:

- A new `carvel-package` resource is added. It stamps out a Tekton Task that
  bundles all application Kubernetes resources into a Carvel `Package`.
- `config-writer` is modified to write the Carvel `Package` to a GitOps
  repository.
- `deliverable` resource is removed.

When a `Workload` is created and all Supply Chain resources are stamped out, a
Carvel `Package` is written to the GitOps repository at the path
`<package_name>/packages/<package_id>.yaml`. `<package_name>` defaults to
`<workload_name>.<workload_namespace>.tap`, and is customized with the
`name_suffix` parameter. `<package_id>` is a SemVer compatible version generated
by the Bash command `$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S.0.0")`.

For example:

```console
app.default.tap/
  packages/
    20230321004057.0.0.yaml
```

>**Note** By default, the `<package_name>` directory is created in the root directory of the GitOps repository. You can optionally create this directory at a subpath by configuring the `gitops_subpath` parameter.

For example, the following Carvel `Package` definition is stored in `<package_id>.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: data.packaging.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: app.default.tap.20230321004057.0.0
spec:
  refName: app.default.tap
  version: 20230321004057.0.0
  releaseNotes: |
    Release v20230321004057.0.0 of package app.default.tap
  template:
    spec:
      fetch:
      - imgpkgBundle:
          image: # imgpkg bundle containing all Kubernetes configuration
      template:
      - ytt:
          paths:
          - .
      - kbld:
          paths:
          - .imgpkg/images.yml
          - '-'
      deploy:
      - kapp: {}
```

The Carvel `Package` generated by the Supply Chain has three configurable parameters:

- `replicas`: Number of pods that you want for the `apps/v1 Deployment`. Default is `1`.
- `hostname`: Host name for the `networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress`. Default is `example.com`.
- `port`: Port for the `networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress`. Default is `8080`.

When a new commit is pushed to the source code Git Repository, such as
`source-to-url-package`, or a new pre-built image is created, like
`basic-image-to-url-package`, the Supply Chain stamps out a new version of the
Carvel `Package`. This definition is written to
`<package_name>/packages/<package_id>.yaml` with a new `<package_id>`.

The Carvel `Package` stored in GitOps repositories are deployed to multiple run
clusters using GitOps tools, such as FluxCD or ArgoCD. See [Deploy Carvel
Packages using FluxCD Kustomization](delivery-with-flux.hbs.md).

## <a id='carvel-package-operator'></a> Installing the Carvel Package Supply Chains as an Operator

This section describes operator tasks for enabling and configuring the Carvel Package Supply Chains.

### Prerequisites

The Carvel Package Supply Chains require access to a GitOps repository and credentials. See [GitOps versus RegistryOps](gitops-vs-regops.hbs.md#gitops).

### Installation

In `tap-values`, configure the [Out of the Box Basic Supply
Chain](ootb-supply-chain-basic.hbs.md) package with the following parameters:

1. (Required) Enable the Carvel Package workflow.

    ```yaml
    ootb_supply_chain_basic:
      carvel_package:
        workflow_enabled: true
    ```

2. (Optional) Set a GitOps subpath. This verifies the path in your GitOps
   repository where Carvel Packages are written. Defaults to `""`. See [Template
   reference](ootb-template-reference.hbs.md#carvel).

    ```yaml
    ootb_supply_chain_basic:
      carvel_package:
        workflow_enabled: true
        gitops_subpath: path/to/my/dir
    ```

3. (Optional) Set a name suffix. Carvel Package names are chosen using the
   `<workload_name>.<workload_namespace>.<name_suffix>` template. Defaults to
   `tap`. See [Template reference](ootb-template-reference.hbs.md#carvel).

    ```yaml
    ootb_supply_chain_basic:
      carvel_package:
        workflow_enabled: true
        name_suffix: vmware.com
    ```

4. Configure the [Out of the Box Basic Supply
   Chain](ootb-supply-chain-basic.hbs.md) package with your GitOps parameters.
   See [GitOps versus RegistryOps](gitops-vs-regops.hbs.md#gitops).

5. Install the [Out of the Box Basic Supply Chain](ootb-supply-chain-basic.hbs.md) package.

### Verifying the Carvel Package Supply Chains are Installed

1. Run `kubectl get ClusterSupplyChains`.
2. Confirm you see both `source-to-url-package` and `basic-image-to-url-package` with status `Ready: True`.

## <a id='carvel-package-developer'></a> Using the Carvel Package Supply Chains as a Developer

This section describes developer tasks for using the Carvel Package Supply Chains.

### Prerequisites

Your operator must [install the Carvel Package Supply Chains](#carvel-package-operator).

### Creating a Workload

To use the Carvel Package Supply Chains, you must add the label `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/carvel-package-workflow=true` to your workload.

1. Use the `--label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/carvel-package-workflow=true` Tanzu CLI flag.

  For example:

  ```console
  tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
    --app tanzu-java-web-app \
    --type server \
    --label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/carvel-package-workflow=true \
    --image IMAGE
  ```

Expect to see the following output:

  ```console
  Create workload:
      1 + |---
      2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
      3 + |kind: Workload
      4 + |metadata:
      5 + |  labels:
      6 + |    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: tanzu-java-web-app
      7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/carvel-package-workflow: "true"
      8 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: server
      9 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
     10 + |  namespace: default
     11 + |spec:
     12 + |  image: IMAGE
  ```

1. (Optional) You can override parameters set by the operator. Set a GitOps subpath. This verifies the path in your GitOps repository to which Carvel Packages are written. Defaults to `""`. See [Template referemce](ootb-template-reference.hbs.md#carvel).

Set this parameter by modifying `workload.spec.params.carvel_package_gitops_subpath`. With the Tanzu CLI, you can do so by using the `--param carvel_package_gitops_subpath=path/to/my/dir` flag.

1. (Optional) Set a name suffix. Carvel Package names are chosen using the template `<workload_name>.<workload_namespace>.<name_suffix>`. Defaults to `tap`. See [Template reference](ootb-template-reference.hbs.md#carvel).

Set this parameter by modifying `workload.spec.params.carvel_package_name_suffix`. With the Tanzu CLI, you can do so by using the `--param carvel_package_name_suffix=vmware.com` flag.

1. (Optional) You can override GitOps parameters. See [GitOps versus RegistryOps](gitops-vs-regops.hbs.md#gitops).

### Verify the Carvel Package was Created

You now see a Carvel `Package` stored in your GitOps repository. For example, at the path `tanzu-java-web-app.default.tap/packages/20230321004057.0.0.yaml` you see a valid Carvel `Package` definition.

### Next Steps

You can deploy the Carvel `Package` using tools such as FluxCD or ArgoCD. See [Deploy Carvel Packages using FluxCD Kustomization](delivery-with-flux.hbs.md).
