# Out of The Box Templates (ootb-templates)

In Cartographer, a supply chain is defined as a directed acyclic graph of
resources that is choreographed by the Cartographer controllers, with the
definition of the shape of such resources defined by templates.

In this package, you'll find a series of reusable templates used by  Out of The
Box Supply Chain Basic, Testing, and Testing with Scanning.

As a prerequisite of the Out of The Box SupplyChains (the three of them), it
must be installed in order to have Workloads being properly delivered.
