To install Out of the Box Delivery Basic:

1. Familiarize yourself with the set of values of the package that can be
   configured by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available get ootb-delivery-basic.tanzu.vmware.com/0.7.0 \
      --values-schema \
      -n tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    KEY                  DEFAULT  TYPE    DESCRIPTION
    service_account      default  string  Name of the service account in the
                                          namespace where the Deliverable is
                                          submitted to.
    ```

1. Create a file named `ootb-delivery-basic-values.yaml` that specifies the
   corresponding values to the properties you want to change.

   For example, the contents of the file might look like this:

    ```yaml
    service_account: default
    ```

1. With the configuration ready, install the package by running:


    ```console
    tanzu package install ootb-delivery-basic \
      --package-name ootb-delivery-basic.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.7.0 \
      --namespace tap-install \
      --values-file ootb-delivery-basic-values.yaml
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
