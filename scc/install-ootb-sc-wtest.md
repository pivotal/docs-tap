Install by following these steps:

1. Ensure you do not have Out of the Box Supply Chain With Testing and Scanning
(`ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning.tanzu.vmware.com`) installed:

    1. Run the following command:

        ```
        tanzu package installed list --namespace tap-install
        ```

    1. Verify `ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning` is in the output:

        ```
        NAME                                PACKAGE-NAME
        ootb-delivery-basic                 ootb-delivery-basic.tanzu.vmware.com
        ootb-supply-chain-basic             ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com
        ootb-templates                      ootb-templates.tanzu.vmware.com
        ```

    1. If you see `ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning` in the list, uninstall it by running:

        ```
        tanzu package installed delete ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning --namespace tap-install
        ```

        Example output:

        ```
        Deleting installed package 'ootb-supply-chain-testing-scanning' in namespace 'tap-install'.
        Are you sure? [y/N]: y

1. Check the values of the package that can be configured by running:

    ```

1. Create a file named `ootb-supply-chain-testing-values.yaml` that specifies the
   corresponding values to the properties you want to change. For example:

    ```
    registry:
      server: REGISTRY-SERVER
      repository: REGISTRY-REPOSITORY

    gitops:
      repository_prefix: ssh://git@github.com:vmware-tanzu/
      branch: main
      user_name: supplychain
      user_email: supplychain
      commit_message: supplychain@cluster.local
      ssh_secret: git-ssh

    cluster_builder: default
    service_account: default
    ```

    >**Note:** it's **required** that the `gitops.repository_prefix` field ends
    > with a `/`.


1. With the configuration ready, install the package by running:

    ```
    tanzu package install ootb-supply-chain-testing \
      --package-name ootb-supply-chain-testing.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.5.1 \
      --namespace tap-install \
      --values-file ootb-supply-chain-testing-values.yaml
    ```

    Example output:

    ```
