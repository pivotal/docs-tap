#### <a id="snyk-scanner"></a> Snyk Scanner (Beta)

- Snyk scanner image scanning integration (Beta) is available for [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](#scst-scan)
  - See [Snyk Installation and Configuration Guide](scst-scan/install-snyk-integration.md) for instructions on how to use Snyk with Tanzu Application Platform Supply Chains

#### Supply Chain Choreographer

- View resource status on a workload
  - Added ability to indicate how Cartographer can read the state of the resource and reflect it on the owner status.
  - Surfaces information about the health of resources directly on the owner status.
  - Adds a field in the spec `healthRule` where authors can specify how to determine the health of the underlying resource for that template. The resource can be in one of the following states: A stamped resource can be in one of three states: 'Healthy' (status True), 'Unhealthy' (status False), or 'Unknown'  (status Unknown). If no healthRule is defined, Cartographer defaults to listing the resource as `Healthy` once it is successfully applied to the cluster and any outputs are read off the resource.
- [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md) v0.1.0 is now bundled with the Supply Chain Choreographer
  - As of v0.07.0 release of [Convention Controller](./convention-service/about.md), it's APIs are deprecated in favor of continuing development on [Cartographer Conventions](./cartographer-conventions/about.md). Cartographer Conventions is now bundled with Supply Chain Choreographer.

#### <a id="scst-scan"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

#### <a id="tbs"></a> Tanzu Build Service

- Updates to dependencies are now provided as part of Tanzu Application Platform patches.
- The automatic dependency update feature is being deprecated.
Configuring Tanzu Application Platform with automatic dependency updates is
not recommended due to compatibility risks.
This feature will receive continued support on existing <!-- previous? which versions? --> Tanzu Application Platform versions.
<!-- Since Auto dep updates is deprecated, does this mean that the tap descriptors are also being phased out? -->

### <a id='1-2-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="scst-scan-changes"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- You must configure integration with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store for the Grype Scanner and Snyk Scanner packages to enable this feature. The configuration for Supply Chain Security Tools - Store in Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan is only for the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s.
- For the profile configuration of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan, the scanning component no longer takes the metadata store configurations as of v1.2.0.
  - For information about configuring metadata store by using the grype component instead of the scanning component as of v1.2.0, see [Install multicluster Tanzu Application Platform profiles
](multicluster/installing-multicluster.md).
  - See [Build profile](multicluster/reference/tap-values-build-sample.md) for the deprecated way of writing the metadata store configuration through the scanning component.
- The rego file structure required for the `ScanPolicies` to work with the Grype Scanner and Snyk Scanner templates changed.
  >**Note:** This doesn't apply if you are using the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s prior to Grype Scanner `v1.2.0`.
  - The package name changed from `package policies` to `package main`.
  - The deny rule changed from the boolean `isCompliant` to the array of strings `deny[msg]`.
  - Please note that the sample `ScanPolicy` is different if you're using Grype Scanner with a CycloneDX structure or Snyk Scanner with a SPDX JSON structure. See [Install Snyk Scanner](./scst-scan/install-snyk-integration) for an example of a Scan Policy.
  - See [Enforce compliance policy using Open Policy Agent](./scst-scan/policies.md) for an example of the current ScanPolicy format for version 1.2.0 and later.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- Breaking change 1
- Breaking change 2

#### <a id="tbs-breaking"></a> Tanzu Build Service

##### <a id="tbs-breaking-upgrading"></a> Breaking Change when Upgrading TAP 1.1 to TAP 1.2

**Note:** If your TAP 1.1 installation was configured with `enable_automatic_updates: false`, this breaking change can be ignored.

When upgrading TAP from 1.1 to 1.2, Tanzu Build Service Image resources will automatically run a build that will fail due to a missing dependency.
This error will not persist and any subsequent builds will resolve this error. This means that users can safely wait for the next build of their workloads which
will be triggered by source code changes.

If you do not want to wait for subsequent builds to run, you can use the open source [kp](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli) cli:

1. List the image resources in the developer namespace:

```console
kp image list -n DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
```

1. Manually trigger the image resources to re-run builds for each failing image:

```console
kp image trigger IMAGE-NAME -n DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
```

#### <a id="grype-scanner-changes"></a> Grype Scanner

- Information to integrate with the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store should be provided in the `tap-values.yaml` file for the Grype Scanner `v1.2+`

  appear as expected.

### <a id='1-2-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### Tanzu Application Platform

- **Failure to connect to AWS EKS clusters:**
When connecting to AWS EKS clusters an error might appear with the text
`Error: Unable to connect: connection refused. Confirm kubeconfig details and try again` or
`invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"`.
To prevent this, see
[Failure to connect to AWS EKS clusters](troubleshooting-tap/troubleshoot-using-tap.md#connect-aws-eks-clusters).

#### Tanzu Cluster Essentials

- Known issue 1
- Known issue 2

#### Application Live View

- Application Live View with custom CA does not support air-gapped installation.

#### Application Single Sign-On

- Application Single Sign-On with custom CA does not support air-gapped installation.

#### Convention Service

- **Issue:**
  If the self-signed certificate authority (CA) for a registry is provided through `convention-controller.ca_cert_data`, it is not successfully propagated to the convention service.

  **Workaround:**
  Define the CA using the available `.shared.ca_cert_data` top-level key to supply the CA to the convention service.

#### Functions (Beta)

- When using LiveUpdate, hot reload of your function on your cluster may not display changes made to your function. To manually push changes to the cluster use the "tilt up" command.

#### Grype scanner

**Scanning Java source code may not reveal vulnerabilities:**
Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
No network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js,
Grype uses the lock files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.

For Java, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
the dependencies present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files) instead.

Because VMware discourages committing binaries to source code repositories,
Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a Source Scan.
The vulnerabilities are still found during the Image Scan,
after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- Known issue 1
- Known issue 2

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- Known issue 1
- Known issue 2

#### Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Supply Chain Plug-in
    - Delivery section of the supply chain graph might show deliverables that do not pertain to the selected workload. This will occur if there are more than one `Build` cluster per namespace
    - In order for `Deliverables` to show up for a given `Workload` they need to have the following labels in both resources:'carto.run/workload-name','app.kubernetes.io/part-of','carto.run/supply-chain-name'
    - ConfigMap has no conditions and as a result its status is reported as `Unknown`
    - ConfigWriter shows an error but no error details are displayed.

#### VSCode Extension

- When debugging an application with service bindings, debug sessions might prematurely end on the
first run only. This is because of services being late-bound.

#### Intellij Extension

- When debugging an application with service bindings, debug sessions might prematurely end on the
first run only. This is because of services being late-bound.
