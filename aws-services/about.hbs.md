# Overview of AWS Services

AWS Services provides an integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Tanzu Application Platform
(commonly known as TAP).

Through integration with [Crossplane](../crossplane/about.hbs.md) and
[Services Toolkit](../services-toolkit/about.hbs.md), you can offer these AWS services for
apps teams to consume with only minimal setup and configuration required from ops teams.
This makes it quick and easy to get started working with AWS services on Tanzu Application Platform.

## <a id="getting-started"></a> Getting started

If this is your first time working with AWS Services on Tanzu Application Platform, you can start by
reading through [About the AWS Services package](concepts/about-aws-services.hbs.md),
which provides you with a better understanding of the goals of the package and some of its limitations.

After you understand the concepts, you can follow the [Quickstart](tutorials/quickstart.hbs.md)
tutorial to get started, or see the [How-to guides](how-to-guides/index.hbs.md) and
[Reference material](reference/index.hbs.md).
