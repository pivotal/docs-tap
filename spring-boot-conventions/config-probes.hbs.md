# Configure liveness, readiness, and startup probes for Spring Boot applications (alpha)

This topic tells you how to override the liveness, readiness, and startup probes' settings for
Spring Boot apps in Tanzu Application Platform. You can override the Kubernetes default
probe settings in `spring-boot-conventions` for containers on Tanzu Application Platform.

> **Caution** This feature is in alpha testing. It is intended for evaluation and test purposes only.

## <a id='probes-overview'></a> Overview of the probes

Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for checking the health and readiness of your Spring Boot
apps. By default, Kubernetes uses specific endpoints provided by Spring Boot Actuator for
liveness and readiness checks. However, you might need to customize these probes to align them with
your app's specific requirements.

| Probe     | Function                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Liveness  | Indicates whether the app is running and responsive. If the probe fails, Kubernetes might restart the container.                                        |
| Readiness | Indicates whether the app is ready to serve requests. If the probe fails, Kubernetes won't route traffic to the container.                              |
| Startup   | Indicates when the app has completed its initialization and is ready to handle traffic. This is especially useful for apps with a slow startup process. |

For more information about the probes, see the
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

## <a id='probes-config'></a> Override the default configurations of the probes

To override the default settings and customize the probes at a cluster level:

1. List the schema for the `spring-boot-conventions` package by running:

   ```console
   tanzu package available get spring-boot-conventions.tanzu.vmware.com/VERSION-NUMBER \
   --values-schema --namespace tap-install
   ```

   Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is the version of the package listed. For example: `1.7.0`.

   For example:

   ```console
   $ tanzu package available get spring-boot-conventions.tanzu.vmware.com/1.7.0 --values-schema --namespace tap-install
        KEY                                          DEFAULT             TYPE     DESCRIPTION

                                                                                   container

                                                                                   the overall check has failed

        startupProbe.initialDelaySeconds               0                 number   Number of seconds after the container has started before probes are initiated
   ```

2. When you install Spring Boot conventions, provide an entry in the `values.yaml` file to override
   the configuration.

   For example:

    ```yaml
    springboot_conventions:
      autoConfigureActuators: true
      livenessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 11
        periodSeconds: 12
        timeoutSeconds: 13
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 14
      readinessProbe:
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 12
        successThreshold: 3
        failureThreshold: 4
    ```

3. Install the package by running:

   ```console
   tanzu package install spring-boot-conventions \
   --package-name spring-boot-conventions.tanzu.vmware.com \
   --version 1.7.0 \
   --namespace tap-install -f values.yaml
   ```

4. Verify that you installed the package by running:

   ```console
   tanzu package installed get spring-boot-conventions --namespace tap-install
   ```

   For example:

   ```console
   tanzu package installed get spring-boot-conventions -n tap-install
   | Retrieving installation details for spring-boot-conventions...
   NAME:                    spring-boot-conventions
   PACKAGE-NAME:            spring-boot-conventions.tanzu.vmware.com
   PACKAGE-VERSION:         1.7.0
   STATUS:                  Reconcile succeeded
   CONDITIONS:              [{ReconcileSucceeded True  }]
   USEFUL-ERROR-MESSAGE:
   ```

   Verify that `STATUS` is `Reconcile succeeded`

   The Spring Boot convention applies the probe and timeout settings at the cluster level to all
   Spring Boot and Spring Native workloads.

5. Verify the `PodIntent` of your workload by ensuring that `spec.containers.livenessProbe` shows the
   overridden configuration values propagated through the Spring Boot conventions

   ```console
   kubectl get podintents.conventions.carto.run tanzu-java-web-app -o yaml

   spec:
     containers:
     - env:
       - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
         value: -Dmanagement.endpoint.health.probes.add-additional-paths="true" -Dmanagement.endpoint.health.show-details="always"
           -Dmanagement.endpoints.web.base-path="/actuator" -Dmanagement.endpoints.web.exposure.include="*"
           -Dmanagement.health.probes.enabled="true" -Dmanagement.server.port="8081"
           -Dserver.port="8080" -Dserver.shutdown.grace-period="24s"
       image: dev.registry.pivotal.io/app-live-view/test/tanzu-java-web-app-default@sha256:fa822a6585eb1287a817a956f16d77dd391624462a626bf37bbf0f9e89ff7562
       livenessProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /livez
           port: 8080
           scheme: HTTP
         initialDelaySeconds: 11
         periodSeconds: 12
         terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 14
         timeoutSeconds: 13
       name: workload
       ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
         protocol: TCP
       readinessProbe:
         failureThreshold: 4
         httpGet:
           path: /readyz
           port: 8080
           scheme: HTTP
         initialDelaySeconds: 15
         periodSeconds: 12
         successThreshold: 3
       resources: {}
       securityContext:
         runAsUser: 1000
       startupProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /startupz
           port: 8080
           scheme: HTTP
   ```

## <a id='additional-paths'></a> Setting additional paths for the probes

The Spring Boot convention automatically sets the `management.endpoint.health.probes.add-additional-paths` to true as long as the Spring Boot application is >= v2.6.0. For any versions below v2.6.0, the property `management.endpoint.health.probes.add-additional-paths` is not supported. 

The `spring-boot-actuator-probes` convention in Spring Boot conventions sets the Liveness, Readiness and Startup probe endpoints to `/livez`, `/readyz` and `readyz` respectively. These endpoints will act as additional endpoint paths on the actuator probes.

For example, when we run `https://tanzu-java-web-app.default.apps.20.22.106.199.nip.io/actuator/health/livez` to check the liveness probe, we can check the health of the application. This helps us evaluate whether an application that is running in a container is in a healthy state or not.

Similarly, when running `https://tanzu-java-web-app.default.apps.20.22.106.199.nip.io/actuator/health/readyz` to check the readiness probe and startup probe, we can evaluate application is ready to receive traffic and whether the application has started up properly.
