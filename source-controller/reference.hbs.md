# Source Controller reference

This topic provides reference documentation for Source Controller.

## <a id="image-repository"></a> ImageRepository [Deprecated]

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ImageRepository
spec:
  image: registry.example/image/repository:tag
  # optional fields
  interval: 5m
  imagePullSecrets: []
  serviceAccountName: default
```

`ImageRepository` resolves source code defined in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image
repository, exposing the resulting source artifact at a URL defined by `.status.artifact.url`.

The interval determines how often to check tagged images for changes. Setting this value too high will result in delays in discovering new sources, while setting it too low may trigger a registry's rate limits.

Repository credentials can be defined as image pull secrets. You can reference them either directly from the resources at `.spec.imagePullSecrets` or attach them to a service account referenced at `.spec.serviceAccountName`. The default service account name `"default"` is used if not otherwise specified. The default credential helpers for the registry are also used, for example, pulling from Google Container Registry (GCR) on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.

## <a id="maven-artifact"></a> MavenArtifact

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: MavenArtifact
metadata:
  name: mavenartifact-sample
spec:
  artifact:
    groupId: org.springframework.boot
    artifactId: spring-boot
    version: "2.7.0"
  repository:
    url: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2
  interval: 5m0s
  timeout: 1m0s
```

`MavenArtifact` resolves artifact from a Maven repository, exposing the resulting artifact at a URL defined by `.status.artifact.url`.

The `interval` determines how often to check artifact for changes. Setting this value too high results in delays in discovering new sources, while setting it too low may trigger a repository's rate limits.

Repository credentials may be defined as secrets referenced from the resources at `.spec.repository.secretRef`. Secrets referenced by `spec.repository.secretRef` is parsed as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: auth-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <BASE64>
  password: <BASE64>
  caFile:   <BASE64>   // PEM Encoded certificate data for Custom CA
  certFile: <BASE64>   // PEM-encoded client certificate
  keyFile:  <BASE64>   // Private Key
```

Maven supports a broad set of `version` syntax. Source Controller supports a strict subset of Maven's version syntax in order to ensure compatibility and avoid user confusion. The subset of supported syntax may grow over time, but will never expand past the syntax defined directly by Maven. This behavior means that we can use `mvn` as a reference implementation for artifact resolution.

Version support implemented in the following order:

1. Pinned version - an exact match of a version in2 `maven-metadata.xml (versioning/versions/version)`.

2. `RELEASE` - metaversion defined in `maven-metadata.xml (versioning/release)`.

3. `*-SNAPSHOT` - the newest artifact for a snapshot version.

4. `LATEST` - metaversion defined in `maven-metadata.xml (versioning/latest)`. 

5. Version ranges - <https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html>. Support is planned for a future release.

>**Note** Pinned versions should be immutable, all other versions are dynamic and can change at any time. The `.spec.interval` defines how frequently to check for updated artifacts.
