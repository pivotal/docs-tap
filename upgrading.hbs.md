# Upgrade your Tanzu Application Platform

This document tells you how to upgrade your Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

You can perform a fresh install of Tanzu Application Platform by following the instructions in [Installing Tanzu Application Platform](install-intro.md).

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before you upgrade Tanzu Application Platform:

- Verify that you meet all the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) of the target Tanzu Application
  Platform version. If the target Tanzu Application Platform version does not support your existing
  Kubernetes version, VMware recommends upgrading to a supported version before proceeding with the
  upgrade.
- For information about installing your Tanzu Application Platform, see
  [Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile](install-online/profile.hbs.md#install-profile).
- Ensure that Tanzu CLI is updated to the version recommended by the target Tanzu Application Platform
  version. For information about installing or updating the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins, see
  [Install or update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md#cli-and-plugin).
- For information about Tanzu Developer Portal (formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI)
  considerations, see [Tanzu Developer Portal Considerations](tap-gui/upgrades.md#considerations).
- Verify all packages are reconciled by running `tanzu package installed list -A`.
- To avoid the temporary warning state that is described in
  [Update the new package repository](#add-new-package-repo), upgrade to Cluster Essentials
  v{{ vars.url_version }}. For more information about the upgrade procedures, see the
  [Cluster Essentials documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/{{ vars.url_version }}/cluster-essentials/deploy.html#upgrade).

## <a id="add-new-package-repo"></a> Update the new package repository

Follow these steps to update the new package repository:

1. Relocate the latest version of Tanzu Application Platform images by following step 1 through step 6 in [Relocate images to a registry](install-online/profile.hbs.md#relocate-images).

    >**Important** Make sure to update the `TAP_VERSION` to the target version of Tanzu Application Platform you are migrating to. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

1. Add the target version of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository by running:

    Cluster Essentials 1.2 or above
    :
    ```console
    tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
    --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tap-packages:$TAP_VERSION \
    --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Cluster Essentials 1.1 or 1.0
    :
    ```console
    tanzu package repository update tanzu-tap-repository \
    --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/TARGET-REPOSITORY/tap-packages:${TAP_VERSION} \
    --namespace tap-install
    ```
    Expect to see the installed Tanzu Application Platform packages in a temporary “Reconcile Failed” state, following a “Package not found” warning. These warnings will disappear after you upgrade the installed Tanzu Application Platform packages to version 1.2.0.

1. Verify you have added the new package repository by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository get TAP-REPO-NAME --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Where `TAP-REPO-NAME` is the package repository name. It must match with either `NEW-TANZU-TAP-REPOSITORY` or `tanzu-tap-repository` in the previous step.

## <a id="upgrade-tap"></a> Perform the upgrade of Tanzu Application Platform

The following sections describe how to upgrade in different scenarios.

### <a id="profile-based-instruct"></a> Upgrade instructions for Profile-based installation

The following changes affect the upgrade procedures:

- **Keyless support deactivated by default**

    In Tanzu Application Platform v1.5.0, keyless support is deactivated by default. For more information, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller](scst-policy/install-scst-policy.hbs.md).

    To support the keyless authorities in `ClusterImagePolicy`, Policy Controller no longer initializes TUF by default. To continue using keyless authorities, you must set the `policy.tuf_enabled` field to `true` in the `tap-values.yaml` file during the upgrade process.

    By default, the public official Sigstore "The Update Framework (TUF) server" is used. You can use an alternative Sigstore Stack by setting `policy.tuf_mirror` and `policy.tuf_root`.

- **Image Policy Webhook no longer in use**

    Tanzu Application Platform v1.5.0 removes Image Policy Webhook. If you use Image Policy Webhook in the previous version of Tanzu Application Platform, you must migrate the `ClusterImagePolicy` resource
    from Image Policy Webhook to Policy Controller. For more information, see [Migration From Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign](scst-policy/migration.hbs.md).

- **CVE results require a read-write service account**

    Tanzu Application Platform v1.3.0 uses a read-only service account. In Tanzu Application Platform v1.4.0 and later, enabling CVE results for the Supply Chain Choreographer and Security Analysis GUI plug-ins requires a read-write service account. For more information, see [Enable CVE scan results](tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.hbs.md#scan).

If you installed Tanzu Application Platform by using a profile, you can perform the upgrade by running the following command in the directory where the `tap-values.yaml` file resides:

```console
tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v ${TAP_VERSION}  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
```

When upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.2, Tanzu Build Service image resources automatically run a build that fails due to a missing dependency.
This error does not persist and any subsequent builds resolve this error.
You can wait for the next build of the workloads that new source code changes trigger.
If you do not want to wait for subsequent builds to run automatically, follow the instructions in
[Builds fail after upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.2](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.2/tap/GUID-tanzu-build-service-troubleshooting.html#builds-fail-after-upgrading-to-tanzu-application-platform).

When upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.5, you might encounter a temporary resource reconciliation failure. This error does not persist and the packages will reconcile subsequently. To facilitate the reconciliation of packages, you can execute the `tanzu package installed kick -n tap-install tap -y` command repeatedly.

### <a id="full-profile-upgrade-tbs-deps"></a> Upgrade the full dependencies package

If you installed the [full dependencies package](install-online/profile.hbs.md#tap-install-full-deps),
you can upgrade the package by following these steps:

1. (Optional) If you have an existing installation of the full dependencies from a version earlier
than TAP v1.6.1, you must uninstall the full dependencies package and remove the package repository.
Subsequent upgrades will not require a removal:

  Uninstall the package

  ```console
  tanzu package installed delete full-tbs-deps -n tap-install
  ```

  Remove the package repository

  ```console
  tanzu package repository delete tbs-full-deps-repository -n tap-install
  ```

1. After upgrading Tanzu Application Platform, retrieve the latest version of the
   Tanzu Application Platform package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list tap.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Relocate the Tanzu Build Service `full` dependencies package repository by running:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/full-deps-package-repo:VERSION \
    --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tbs-full-deps
    ```

    Where `VERSION` is the version of the Tanzu Application Platform package you retrieved in the previous step.

3. Update the Tanzu Build Service  `full` dependencies package repository by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository add full-deps-repository \
      --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tbs-full-deps:VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

4. Update the `full` dependencies package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update full-deps -p full-deps.buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com -v VERSION -n tap-install
    ```

### <a id="upgrade-order"></a> Multicluster upgrade order

Upgrading a [multicluster deployment](multicluster/installing-multicluster.hbs.md) requires updating multiple clusters with different profiles.
If upgrades are not performed at the exact same time, different clusters have different versions of profiles installed temporarily.
This might cause a temporary API mismatch that leads to errors.
Those errors eventually disappear when the versions are consistent across all clusters.

To reduce the likelihood of temporary failures, follow these steps to upgrade your multicluster deployment:

1. Upgrade the view-profile cluster.
1. Upgrade the remaining clusters in any order.
