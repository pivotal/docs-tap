# Installing the Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles

This topic describes how to install Tanzu Application Platform packages
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

Before installing the packages, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites, configured
and verified the cluster, accepted the EULA, and installed the Tanzu CLI with any required plug-ins.
See [Accepting Tanzu Application Platform EULA and installing Tanzu CLI](install-tanzu-cli.md) for more information.


## <a id='add-tap-package-repo'></a> Relocate images to a registry

VMware recommends relocating the images to your registry from VMware Tanzu Network registry before
attempting installation.

If you choose not to relocate images, Tanzu Application Platform depends directly on
VMware Tanzu Network for continued operation.
VMware recommends relocating images because there are no uptime guarantees for installations that
depend directly on VMware Tanzu Network.
The option to skip relocation is documented for evaluation and proof-of-concept only.

The supported container registries are Harbor, Azure Container Registry, Google Container Registry,
and Quay.io.
See the documentation for a registry to learn how to set it up.

To relocate images from the VMware Tanzu Network registry to your registry:

1. Log in to your image registry by running:

    ```console
    docker login MY-REGISTRY
    ```

    Where `MY-REGISTRY` is your own container registry.

1. Log in to the VMware Tanzu Network registry with your VMware Tanzu Network credentials by running:

    ```console
    docker login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    ```

1. Set up environment variables for installation use by running:

    ```console
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=MY-REGISTRY-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=MY-REGISTRY
    export TAP_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    ```

    Where:

    - `MY-REGISTRY-USER` is the user with write access to `MY-REGISTRY`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-REGISTRY-USER`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY` is your own container registry.
    - `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

1. Relocate the images with the Carvel tool imgpkg by running:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:${TAP_VERSION} --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/TARGET-REPOSITORY/tap-packages
    ```

    Where `TARGET-REPOSITORY` is your target repository

1. Create a namespace called `tap-install` for deploying any component packages by running:

    ```console
    kubectl create ns tap-install
    ```

    This namespace keeps the objects grouped together logically.

1. Create a registry secret by running:

    ```console
    tanzu secret registry add tap-registry \
      --username ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME} --password ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD} \
      --server ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME} \
      --export-to-all-namespaces --yes --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository to the cluster by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
      --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/TARGET-REPOSITORY/tap-packages:$TAP_VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Where:

    - `$TAP_VERSION` is the Tanzu Application Platform version environment variable you defined earlier.
    - `TARGET-REPOSITORY` is the necessary repository.

1. Get the status of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    - Retrieving repository tap...
    NAME:          tanzu-tap-repository
    VERSION:       16253001
    REPOSITORY:    tapmdc.azurecr.io/mdc/1.0.2/tap-packages
    TAG:           1.0.2
    STATUS:        Reconcile succeeded
    REASON:
    ```

    > **Note:** The `VERSION` and `TAG` numbers differ from the earlier example if you are on
    > Tanzu Application Platform v1.0.2 or earlier.

1. List the available packages by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    / Retrieving available packages...

## <a id='install-profile'></a> Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile

The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package installs predefined sets of packages based on your profile settings. 
This is done by using the package manager installed by Tanzu Cluster Essentials.

For more information about profiles, see [About Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles](about-package-profiles.md).

To prepare to install a profile:

1. List version information for the package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list tap.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Create a `tap-values.yaml` file by using the
[Full Profile sample](#full-profile) as a guide.
These samples have the minimum configuration required to deploy Tanzu Application Platform.
The sample values file contains the necessary defaults for:

    - The meta-package, or parent Tanzu Application Platform package
    - Subordinate packages, or individual child packages

    >**Important:** Keep the values file for future configuration use.

1. Proceed to the [View possible configuration settings for your package](#view-pkge-config-settings)
section.

### <a id='full-profile'></a> Full Profile

The following is the YAML file sample for the full-profile:

```yaml
profile: full

shared:
  ingress_domain: INGRESS-DOMAIN

ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.
buildservice:
  kp_default_repository: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO"
  kp_default_repository_username: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME"
  kp_default_repository_password: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD"
  tanzunet_username: "TANZUNET-USERNAME"
  tanzunet_password: "TANZUNET-PASSWORD"
  descriptor_name: "DESCRIPTOR-NAME"

supply_chain: basic

ootb_supply_chain_basic:
  registry:
    server: "SERVER-NAME"
    repository: "REPO-NAME"
  gitops:
    ssh_secret: "SSH-SECRET-KEY"

tap_gui:
  service_type: ClusterIP
  app_config:
    app:
      baseUrl: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
    catalog:
      locations:
        - type: url
          target: https://GIT-CATALOG-URL/catalog-info.yaml
    backend:
      baseUrl: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
      cors:
        origin: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN

metadata_store:
  ns_for_export_app_cert: "MY-DEV-NAMESPACE"
  app_service_type: ClusterIP

grype:
  namespace: "MY-DEV-NAMESPACE" # (optional) Defaults to default namespace.
  targetImagePullSecret: "TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET"
```

Where:

- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `kp_default_repository: "index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `kp_default_repository: "gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME` is the username that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential.
    * For Google Cloud Registry, use `kp_default_repository_username: _json_key`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD` is the password for the user that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential. You can also configure this credential by using a secret reference. See [Install Tanzu Build Service](tanzu-build-service/install-tbs.html#install-secret-refs) for details.
    * For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account JSON file.
- `TANZUNET-USERNAME` and `TANZUNET-PASSWORD` are the email address and password to log in to VMware Tanzu Network. Your VMware Tanzu Network credentials enable you to configure the dependencies updater. This resource accesses and installs the build dependencies (buildpacks and stacks) that Tanzu Build Service requires on your cluster. It can also optionally keep these dependencies up to date as new versions are released on VMware Tanzu Network. You can also configure this credential by using a secret reference. For more information, see [Install Tanzu Build Service](tanzu-build-service/install-tbs.html#install-secret-refs).
- `DESCRIPTOR-NAME` is the name of the descriptor to import. For more information, see [Overview of Tanzu Build Service](tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.html#descriptors). Available options are:
    * `lite` is the default if not set. It has a smaller footprint, which enables faster installations.
    * `full` is optimized to speed up builds and includes dependencies for all supported workload types.
- `SERVER-NAME` is the hostname of the registry server. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `server: "my-harbor.io"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `server: "index.docker.io"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `server: "gcr.io"`
- `REPO-NAME` is where workload images are stored in the registry.
Images are written to `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME/workload-name`. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `repository: "my-dockerhub-user"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`
- `SSH-SECRET-KEY` is the SSH secret key in the developer namespace for the supply chain to fetch source code from and push configuration to.
- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's External IP address.
- `GIT-CATALOG-URL` is the path to the `catalog-info.yaml` catalog definition file. You can download either a blank or populated catalog file from the [Tanzu Application Platform product page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-application-platform/#/releases/1043418/file_groups/6091). Otherwise, you can use a Backstage-compliant catalog you've already built and posted on the Git infrastructure.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you want to deploy the `ScanTemplates`.
This is the namespace where the scanning feature runs.
- `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the secret that contains the
credentials to pull an image from the registry for scanning.
If built images are pushed to the same registry as the Tanzu Application Platform images,
this can reuse the `tap-registry` secret created in
[Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository](#add-tap-package-repo).

> **Note:** When you install Tanzu Application Platform, it is bootstrapped with
> a set of dependencies (buildpacks and stacks) for application builds.
> For more information about buildpacks, see the [VMware Tanzu Buildpacks Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/index.html).
> You can find the buildpack and stack artifacts installed with Tanzu Application Platform
> in the descriptor file on [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies).
> The current installed version of the descriptor is
> [100.0.293](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies#/releases/1086670). Sometimes the dependencies
> require updates. You can use a
> [manual process in a CI/CD context](tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.html#dependencies-manual), or
> an [automatic update process](tanzu-build-service/tbs-about.html#auto-updates)
> in the background by Tanzu Application Platform.

### <a id='light-profile'></a> Light Profile

The Light profile is deprecated. Although existing values files might still refer to the Light profile, VMware recommends to migrate to one of the new profiles described in [Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile](#install-profile) by following the procedures in [Migrate Tanzu Application Platform profiles](migrate-profile.md).

### <a id="view-pkge-config-settings"></a>View possible configuration settings for your package

To view possible configuration settings for a package, run:

```console
tanzu package available get tap.tanzu.vmware.com/$TAP_VERSION --values-schema --namespace tap-install
```

Where `$TAP_VERSION` is the Tanzu Application Platform version environment variable
you defined earlier.

>**Note:** The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package does not show all configuration settings for packages
>it plans to install. The package only shows top-level keys.
>You can view individual package configuration settings with the same `tanzu package available get` command.
>For example, use `tanzu package available get -n tap-install cnrs.tanzu.vmware.com/1.0.3 --values-schema` for Cloud Native Runtimes.

```yaml
profile: full

# ...

# e.g. CNRs specific values go under its name
cnrs:
  provider: local

# e.g. App Accelerator specific values go under its name
accelerator:
  server:
    service_type: "ClusterIP"
```

### <a id="identify-values"></a>Identify the values for your package

You can identify the values for your Tanzu package by running:

```console
tanzu package available get PACKAGE-NAME.tanzu.vmware.com/VERSION --values-schema -n tap-install
```

Where:

- `VERSION` is the version number of the package. For example, `0.5.1` for Supply Chain Basic package.
- `PACKAGE-NAME` is the value of `Top-level Key` for package-specific configuration within
your `tap-values.yaml`, as summarized in the following table:  

|Package|Top-level Key|
|----|----|
|_see table below_|`shared`|
|API portal|`api_portal`|
|Application Accelerator|`accelerator`|
|Application Live View|`appliveview`|
|Application Live View Connector|`appliveview_connector`|
|Application Live View Conventions|`appliveview-conventions`|
|Cartographer|`cartographer`|
|Cloud Native Runtimes|`cnrs`|
|Convention Controller|`convention_controller`|
|Source Controller|`source_controller`|
|Supply Chain|`supply_chain`|
|Supply Chain Basic|`ootb_supply_chain_basic`|
|Supply Chain Testing|`ootb_supply_chain_testing`|
|Supply Chain Testing Scanning|`ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning`|
|Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan|`scanning`|
|Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan (Grype Scanner)|`grype`|
|Supply Chain Security Tools - Store|`metadata_store`|
|Image Policy Webhook|`image_policy_webhook`|
|Build Service|`buildservice`|
|Tanzu Application Platform GUI|`tap_gui`|
|Learning Center|`learningcenter`|

Shared Keys define values that configure multiple packages. These keys are defined under the `shared` Top-level Key, as summarized in the following table:

|Shared Key|Used By|Description|
|----|----|----|
|`ca_cert_data`|`convention_controller`, `source_controller`|Optional: PEM Encoded certificate data to trust TLS connections with a private CA.|

For information about package-specific configuration, see [Installing individual packages](install-components.md).

For example, to identify the SSH secret keys for Supply Chain Basic, you can run:

```console
tanzu package available get ootb-supply-chain-basic.tanzu.vmware.com/0.5.1 --values-schema -n tap-install
```

Expect to see the following outputs that list the all the SSH secret keys and the descriptions applicable to the package:

```console
KEY                       DEFAULT                    TYPE    DESCRIPTION
cluster_builder           default                    string  Name of the Tanzu Build Service (TBS) ClusterBuilder to use by default on image objects managed by the supply chain.

gitops.branch             main                       string  Default branch to use for pushing Kubernetes configuration files produced by the supply chain.

gitops.commit_message     bump configuration         string  Default git commit message to write when publishing Kubernetes configuration files produces by the supply chain to git.

gitops.email              supplychain@cluster.local  string  Default user email to be used for the commits produced by the supply chain.

gitops.repository_prefix  <nil>                      string  Default prefix to be used for forming Git SSH URLs for pushing Kubernetes configuration produced by the supply chain.

gitops.ssh_secret         git-ssh                    string  Name of the default Secret containing SSH credentials to lookup in the developer namespace for the supply chain to fetch source code from and push configuration to.

gitops.username           supplychain                string  Default user name to be used for the commits produced by the supply chain.

registry.repository       <nil>                      string  Name of the repository in the image registry server where the application images from the workloads should be pushed to (required).

registry.server           index.docker.io            string  Name of the registry server where application images should be pushed to (required).

service_account           default                    string  Name of the service account in the namespace where the Workload is submitted to utilize for providing registry credentials to Tanzu Build Service (TBS) Image objects as well as deploying the application.
```  

## <a id="install-package"></a>Install your Tanzu Application Platform package

Follow these steps to install the Install the Tanzu Application Platform package:

1. Install the package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package install tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v $TAP_VERSION --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

    Where `$TAP_VERSION` is the Tanzu Application Platform version environment variable
    you defined earlier.

1. Verify the package install by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed get tap -n tap-install
    ```

    This may take 5-10 minutes because it installs several packages on your cluster.

1. Verify that all the necessary packages in the profile are installed by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed list -A
    ```

After installing Full Profile on to your cluster, you can install the
Tanzu Developer Tools for VSCode extension to help you develop against it.
For instructions, see [Installing Tanzu Dev Tools for VSCode](vscode-extension/installation.md).

## <a id="configure-envoy-lb"></a> Configure LoadBalancer for Contour ingress

This section only applies when you use Tanzu Application Platform to deploy its own shared Contour ingress controller in `tanzu-system-ingress`. It is not applicable when you use your existing ingress.

You can share this ingress across Cloud Native Runtimes (`cnrs`), Tanzu Application Platform GUI (`tap_gui`), and Learning Center (`learningcenter`).

By default, Contour uses `NodePort` as the service type. To set the service type to `LoadBalancer`, add the following to your `tap-values.yaml`:

```yaml
contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
```

If you use AWS, the section above creates a classic LoadBalancer.
If you want to use the Network LoadBalancer instead of the classic LoadBalancer for ingress, add the
following to your `tap-values.yaml`:

```yaml
contour:
  infrastructure_provider: aws
  envoy:
    service:
      aws:
        LBType: nlb
```

## <a id='access-tap-gui'></a> Access Tanzu Application Platform GUI

To access Tanzu Application Platform GUI, you can use the hostname that you configured earlier. This hostname is pointed at the shared ingress. To configure LoadBalancer for Tanzu Application Platform GUI, see [Accessing Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/accessing-tap-gui.md.hbs).

You're now ready to start using Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
Proceed to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) topic or the
[Tanzu Application Platform GUI - Catalog Operations](tap-gui/catalog/catalog-operations.md) topic.

## <a id='exclude-packages'></a> Exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile

To exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile:

1. Find the full subordinate (child) package name:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Update your `tap-values` file with a section listing the exclusions:

    ```console
    profile: PROFILE-VALUE
    excluded_packages:
      - tap-gui.tanzu.vmware.com
      - service-bindings.lab.vmware.com
    ```

>**Important:** If you exclude a package after performing a profile installation including that package, you cannot see the accurate package states immediately after running `tap package installed list -n tap-install`.

>**Warning:** You can break package dependencies by removing a package. Allow 20 minutes to verify that all packages have reconciled correctly while troubleshooting.
