# Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu â€“ Store

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store saves software bills of materials (SBoMs) to a database and allows you to query for image, source, package, and vulnerability relationships.  It integrates with [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/overview.md) to automatically store the resulting source and image vulnerability reports. It accepts any CycloneDX input and outputs in both human-readable and machine-readable formats, including JSON, text, and CycloneDX.


The following is a four-minute demo of scanning an image for CVEs and querying the database for CVEs and dependencies.

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store has three components:

* [API](api.md)
* [CLI](install_cli.md) (Insight)
* Postgres database

## Install

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is released as an individual Tanzu Application Platform component.

To install, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](../install-components.md#install-scst-store).  It will install the Postgres database and an [API](api.md) backend.

> **Note:** The Insight CLI requires a [separate installation](install_cli.md).

For more information, see [Deployment Details and Configuration](deployment_details.md).

### Required

The following steps are required to use the API or CLI:

* [Using encryption and connection](using_encryption_and_connection.md)
* [Create a service account and get the access token](create_service_account_access_token.md)

### Recommended

The Insight CLI is not required but may provide an easier-to-use interface than the [API](api.md).  

> **Note:** The Insight CLI is in beta and is separate from the Tanzu CLI.

* [Install the CLI](install_cli.md)
* [Configure the CLI](configure_cli.md)

## <a id='usage'></a>Usage

### Adding data

See [adding data](add_cyclonedx_to_store.md) to post CycloneDX scan reports to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store.

### Querying data

See [querying data](querying_the_metadata_store.md) to understand vulnerability, image, and dependency relationships.

## Auditing

The API server outputs logs when an endpoint is accessed, which can be used for auditing purposes. For information about the logs generated, see [Configuring and Understanding Store Logs](logs.md).
