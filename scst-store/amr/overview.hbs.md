# Artifact Metadata Repository (alpha/beta)

This topic gives you an overview of Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR).

>**Important** SCST - Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) has components with
>alpha and beta statuses, meaning that it is still in active development and is
>subject to change at any point. Users might encounter unexpected behavior. This
>is an opt-in component to gather early feedback from alpha and beta testers and
>is not installed by default with any profile.

## <a id='observer'></a> AMR Observer (alpha)

AMR Observer is a set of managed controllers that watches for relevant updates
on resources of interest. When relevant events are observed, a CloudEvent is
generated and sent to AMR CloudEvent-Handler to be relayed for storage in the
Metadata Store. For information about CloudEvents, see [CloudEvent JSON
Specification](./cloudevents.hbs.md).

## <a id='handler'></a> AMR CloudEvent Handler (beta)

AMR CloudEvent Handler receives CloudEvents from other sources, such as the AMR
Observer, and stores relevant information into the Artifact Metadata Repository
or Metadata Store.

## <a id='ki'></a> Known Issues

The following known issues are associated with SCST - AMR:

- Periodic reconciliation or restarting of the AMR Observer causes reattempted
  posting of ImageVulnerabilityScan results. There is an error on duplicate
  submission of identical ImageVulnerabilityScans that you can ignore if the
  previous submission was successful.
- ReplicaSet status in Artifact Metadata Repository has two states:
  `created` and `deleted`. There is a known issue where the `available` and
  `unavailable` states are not showing. The workaround is that you can
  interpolate information from the `instances` metadata in the AMR for the
  ReplicaSet.
