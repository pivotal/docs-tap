# Multicluster setup

Deploying Tanzu Application Platform in a multicluster setup includes installing
multiple profiles such as, View, Build, Run, and Iterate.

SCST - Store is deployed with the View profile. After
installing the View profile, but before installing the Build profile, you must
add configuration for SCST - Store to the Kubernetes cluster where you intend to install the Build profile.
This topic explains how to add configuration which allows components in the Build
cluster to communicate with SCST - Store in the View cluster.

> **Note** If you already deployed the Build profile, you can follow
> this procedure. However, in the [Install Build
> profile](#install-build-profile) step, instead of deploying the Build profile
> again, update your deployment using `tanzu package installed update`.

## Prerequisites

You must install the View profile. See [Install View profile](../multicluster/installing-multicluster.hbs.md#install-view).

## Procedure summary

1. Copy SCST - Store CA certificate from the View cluster.
2. Copy SCST - Store authentication token from the View cluster.
3. Apply the CA certificate and authentication token to the Kubernetes cluster where you intend to install the Build profile.
4. Install the Build profile.

## Copy SCST - Store CA certificate from View cluster

With your kubectl targeted at the View cluster, you can view SCST - Store's TLS
CA certificate. Run these commands to copy the CA certificate into a file
`store_ca.yaml`.

```bash
CA_CERT=$(kubectl get secret -n metadata-store CERT-NAME -o json | jq -r ".data.\"ca.crt\"")
cat <<EOF > store_ca.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: store-ca-cert
  namespace: metadata-store-secrets
data:
  ca.crt: $CA_CERT
EOF
```

Where `CERT-NAME` is the name of the certificate you want to reference in `store_ca.yaml`.

For example:

```bash
$ CA_CERT=$(kubectl get secret -n metadata-store ingress-cert -o json | jq -r ".data.\"ca.crt\"")
$ cat <<EOF > store_ca.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: store-ca-cert
  namespace: metadata-store-secrets
data:
  ca.crt: $CA_CERT
EOF
```

## Copy SCST - Store authentication token from the View cluster

Copy the SCST - Store authentication token into an environment variable. You use
this environment variable in the next step.

```bash
AUTH_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secrets metadata-store-read-write-client -n metadata-store -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 -d)
```

## Apply the CA certificate and authentication token to a new Kubernetes cluster

Before you deploy the Build profile, you must apply the CA certificate and
authentication token from the earlier steps. Then the Build profile deployment
has access to these values.

To apply the CA certificate and authentication token:

1. With your kubectl targeted at the Build cluster, create a namespace for the CA
certificate and authentication token.

    ```bash
    kubectl create ns metadata-store-secrets
    ```

1. Apply the CA certificate `store_ca.yaml` secret YAML you generated earlier.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f store_ca.yaml
    ```

1. Create a secret to store the access token. This uses the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic store-auth-token \
      --from-literal=auth_token=$AUTH_TOKEN -n metadata-store-secrets
    ```

The cluster now has a CA certificate named  `store-ca-cert` and authentication
token named `store-auth-token` in the namespace `metadata-store-secrets`.

## <a id='install-build-profile'></a>Install Build profile

If you came to this topic from the [Install multicluster Tanzu Application
Platform profiles](../multicluster/installing-multicluster.hbs.md) topic after
installing the View profile, return to that topic to [install the Build
profile](../multicluster/installing-multicluster.hbs.md#install-build).

The Build profile `values.yaml` contains configuration that references the
secrets in the `metadata-store-secrets` namespace you created in this guide. The
names of these secrets are hard coded in the example `values.yaml`.

### More information about how Build profile uses the configuration

The secrets you created are used in the Build profile `values.yaml` to configure
the Grype scanner which talks to SCST - Store. After performing a vulnerabilities
scan, the Grype scanner sends the results to SCST - Store. Here's a snippet of
what the configuration might look like.

```yaml
...
grype:
  namespace: "MY-DEV-NAMESPACE" # (Optional) Defaults to default namespace.
  targetImagePullSecret: "TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET"
  metadataStore:
    url: METADATA-STORE-URL-ON-VIEW-CLUSTER # Url with http / https
    caSecret:
        name: store-ca-cert
        importFromNamespace: metadata-store-secrets # Must match with `ingress-cert.data."ca.crt"` of store on view cluster
    authSecret:
        name: store-auth-token # Must match with valid store token of metadata-store on view cluster
        importFromNamespace: metadata-store-secrets
...
```

Where:

- `METADATA-STORE-URL-ON-VIEW-CLUSTER` is the ingress URL of SCST - Store
  deployed to the View cluster. For example,
  `https://metadata-store.example.com`. See [Ingress support](ingress.hbs.md).
- `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the secret that contains
  the credentials to pull an image from the registry for scanning.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the name of the developer namespace. SCST - Scan deploys
  the ScanTemplates there. This allows the scanning feature to run in this
  namespace.

## Configure developer namespaces

After you finish the entire Tanzu Application Platform installation process, you
are ready to configure developer namespaces. To prepare developer namespaces,
you must export the secrets you created earlier to those namespaces.

### <a id="export-multicluster"></a> Exporting SCST - Store secrets to a developer namespace in a Tanzu Application Platform multicluster deployment

Export secrets to a developer namespace by creating `SecretExport` resources on
the developer namespace. Run the following command to create the `SecretExport`
resources. You must have created and populated the `metadata-store-secrets`
namespace.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SecretExport
metadata:
  name: store-ca-cert
  namespace: metadata-store-secrets
spec:
  toNamespaces: [DEV-NAMESPACES]
---
apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SecretExport
metadata:
  name: store-auth-token
  namespace: metadata-store-secrets
spec:
  toNamespaces: [DEV-NAMESPACES]
EOF
```

Where `[DEV-NAMESPACES]` is an array of developer namespaces where the secrets are exported.
