    >**Note:** macOS is a Darwin-based platform.
    
1. Put the binary in a location that is either already in your `PATH` environment variable, 
or add the location of the CLI to your `PATH` variable.
1. Rename the binary to make it easier to invoke with your command line. 
For example, `mv insight-1.0.0-beta.2_darwin_amd64 insight`.

macOS does not recognize that the insight binary is safe to run because Apple has not signed it. To allow your computer to run the binary, perform the following steps:

1. In the command line, run: 

    ```
    insight version
    ```
    A pop-up appears to notify you that the program is not trusted.

1. Open **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **General**.
1. Under **Allow apps identified from**, ensure the **App store and identified developers** radio button is selected.
1. Re-run the insight binary until an **Allow** button appears under the **Allow apps identified from** section, and then click **Allow**.
