# Using Encryption and Connecting to Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

The connection to the Store requires TLS encryption. Follow the instructions below to set up the TLS connection depending on which type of service is being used:

1. Using `LoadBalancer`
1. Using `NodePort` â€” commonly used with local clusters such as kind, or minikube

## Using `LoadBalancer`

If you are using a `LoadBalancer` configuration, you need to find the external IP of the `metadata-store-app` service. You can use `kubectl` to do this.

**Note**: For all `kubectl` commands, use the `--namespace metadata-store` flag.

```
kubectl get service/metadata-store-app --namespace metadata-store -o yaml
```

For example:

```
$ kubectl get service/metadata-store-app --namespace metadata-store -o yaml
...
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 32712
    port: 8443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: PORT
...
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - ip: IP-ADDRESS
```
Where:

- `IP-ADDRESS` is your IP address.
- `PORT` is your port number.

### Obtaining the CA Certificate

The CA certificate is generated by cert manager. Run the following command to get the CA certificate:

```
kubectl get secret app-tls-cert -n metadata-store -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"' | base64 -d > PATH
```

Where:

- `PATH` is the location where you want to save the CA certificate. This file is used later when you [configure the CLI](configure_cli.md).

### Editing `/etc/hosts`

To add the IP entry mapping to `metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local` in `/etc/hosts`. Add this line:

```
IP metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local
```

Where:

- `IP` is the IP you got from the step *Using `LoadBalancer`* step above.

For example:

```
10.186.124.220 metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local
```

## Using `NodePort`
To use NodePort, obtain the CA cert, configure portforwarding, and modify the `/etc/hosts` file.

### Obtaining the CA Cert

The CA Certificate is generated by cert manager. Run the following command to get the CA certificate:

```
kubectl get secret app-tls-cert -n metadata-store -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"' | base64 -d > PATH
```

Where:

- `PATH` is the location where you want to save the CA certificate. This file is used later when you [configure the CLI](configure_cli.md).

### Configuring Port Forwarding
When using `NodePort`, you need to configure port forwarding for the service for the CLI to access the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store. Run:

```
kubectl port-forward service/metadata-store-app 8443:8443 -n metadata-store
```

Run this command in a separate terminal window since it takes over the terminal.

### Modifying your `/etc/hosts` file

Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts` by running:

```
127.0.0.1 metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local
```
