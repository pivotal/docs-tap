# Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu – Store

This topic gives you an overview of Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) – Store.

## Overview

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store saves software bills of materials (SBoMs) to a database and allows you to query for image, source code, package, and vulnerability relationships.  It integrates with [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/overview.md) to automatically store the resulting source code and image vulnerability reports. It accepts CycloneDX input and outputs in both human-readable and machine-readable formats, including JSON, text, and CycloneDX.

The following is a quick demo of configuring the tanzu insight plug-in and querying the metadata store for CVEs and scan results.

## Using the Tanzu Insight CLI plug-in

the Tanzu Insight CLI plug-in is the primary way to view results from the Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan of source code and image files.  Use it to query by source code commit, image digest, and CVE identifier to understand security risks.

See [Tanzu Insight plug-in overview](../cli-plugins/insight/cli-overview.md) to install, configure, and use `tanzu insight`.

## Multicluster configuration

See [Multicluster setup](multicluster-setup.hbs.md) for information about how to set up SCST - Store in a multicluster setup.

## Integrating with Tanzu Developer Portal

Using the Supply Chain Choreographer in Tanzu Developer Portal
(formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI), you can visualize your supply chain.
It uses to SCST - Store to show the packages and vulnerabilities in your source code and images.
