# Ingress support

Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Store has ingress support by using Contour's HTTPProxy resources. To enable ingress support, a Contour installation must be available in the cluster.

To change ingress configuration, modify your `tap-values.yaml` when you install a TAP profile. Configure the `shared.ingress_domain` property and SCST - Store will automatically use that setting.

Alternatively, you can customize SCST - Store's configuration under the `metadata_store` property. Under `metadata_store`, there are two values to configure the proxy: `ingress_enabled` and `ingress_domain`.

This is an example snippet in a `tap-values.yaml`,

```yaml
...
metadata_store:
  ingress_enabled: "true"
  ingress_domain: "example.com"
  app_service_type: "ClusterIP"  # Defaults to `LoadBalancer`. If ingress is enabled then this should be set to `ClusterIP`.
...
```

SCST - Store installation creates an HTTPProxy entry with host routing by using the qualified name `metadata-store.<ingress_domain>`, for example `metadata-store.example.com`. The created route supports HTTPS communication using a certificate. By default, a self-signed certificate is used with the same subject *Alternative Name*. See [Custom certificate configuration](custom-cert.hbs.md) for information on how to configure custom certificates.

Contour and DNS setup are not part of the SCST - Store installation. Access to SCST - Store using Contour depends on the correct configuration of these two components.

Make the proper DNS record available to clients to resolve `metadata-store.<ingress_domain>` to Envoy service's external IP address.

DNS setup example,

```bash
$ kubectl describe svc envoy -n tanzu-system-ingress
> ...
  Type:                     LoadBalancer
  ...
  LoadBalancer Ingress:     100.2.3.4
  ...
  Port:                     https  443/TCP
  ...

$ nslookup metadata-store.example.com
> Server:    8.8.8.8
  Address:  8.8.8.8#53

  Non-authoritative answer:
  Name:  metadata-store.example.com
  Address: 100.2.3.4

$ curl https://metadata-store.example.com/api/health -k -v
> ...
  < HTTP/2 200
  ...
```

>**Note:** The preceding `curl` example uses the not secure (`-k`) flag to skip TLS verification because the Store installs a self-signed certificate. The following section shows how to access the CA certificate to enable TLS verification for HTTP clients.

## <a id="tls"></a>Get the TLS CA certificate

To get SCST - Store's TLS CA certificate, use `kubectl get secret`. In this example, we save the certificate to the environment variable to a file.

```bash
kubectl get secret CERT-NAME -n metadata-store -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"' | base64 -d > OUTPUT_FILE
```

Where

* `CERT-NAME` is the name of the certificate, this must be `ingress-cert` if no custom certificate is used.
* `OUTPUT_FILE` is the file you want to create to store the certificate

For example,

```bash
$ kubectl get secret ingress-cert -n metadata-store -o json | jq -r '.data."ca.crt"' | base64 -d > insight-ca.crt
$ cat insight-ca.crt
```
