### <a id='1-8-0-new-features'></a> v1.8.0 New features by component and area

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-8-0-aws-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: AWS Services

- Adds the service Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ. To enable the new service, set `rabbitmq.enabled: true`
  in your `aws-services-values.yaml`. For more configuration options, see
  [Package values for AWS Services](aws-services/reference/package-values.hbs.md).

- Adds the package value `crossplane.role_arn`. Users can specify a `role_arn`, which causes
  the Provider pods to run as a service account that is mapped to the corresponding IAM role in AWS.

- Updates upbound/provider-aws from v0.39.0 to v0.46.0.

#### <a id='1-8-0-bitnami-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Bitnami Services

- Updates all Compositions to use function pipelines rather than Crossplane’s default patch and transform.
  New instances created using a class claim are now composed using the new Compositions.
  There is no change to how the resulting composed service instances operate.
  There is no impact to existing instances.

#### <a id='1-8-0-crossplane'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Crossplane

- Updates [Universal Crossplane](https://github.com/upbound/universal-crossplane) to v1.14.5-up.1
  For more information, see the [Upbound blog](https://blog.crossplane.io/crossplane-v1-14/).

- Updates provider-helm to v0.16.0.

- Updates provider-kubernetes to v0.11.0.

- Adds support for composition functions. Composition functions are beta in for Crossplane v1.14.
  For more information, see the [Upbound Documentation](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/composition-functions).

- Adds the patch and transform function. Users who want to use function pipelines in their Compositions
  can use this function without having to explicitly install it.

#### <a id='1-8-0-service-bindings'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Service Bindings

- Updates [servicebinding/runtime](https://github.com/servicebinding/runtime) to v0.7.0.
  This update fixes the issue of `ServiceBinding` not immediately reconciling when `status.binding.name`
  changes on a previously bound service resource.

#### <a id='1-8-0-services-toolkit'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Services Toolkit

- Updates reconciler-runtime to v0.15.1.

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-8-0-COMPONENT-NAME-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Service Bindings

- Resolved an issue in which `ServiceBinding` is not immediately reconciled when `status.binding.name`
  changes on a previously bound service resource.

#### <a id='1-8-0-scst-store-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store
