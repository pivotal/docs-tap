#### <a id='1-9-0-alm-ri'></a> v1.9.0 Resolved issues: App Last Mile Catalog

---

### <a id='1-9-0-known-issues'></a> v1.9.0 Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-9-0-scst-policy-ki'></a> v1.9.0 Known issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy

- Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy is defaulting to TUF enabled due to incorrect logic.
This might cause the package to not reconcile correctly if the default TUF mirrors are not reachable.
To work around this, explicitly configure policy controller in the `tap-values.yaml` file to
enable TUF:

  ```yaml
  policy:
    tuf_enabled: true
  ```

#### <a id='1-9-0-scst-store-ki'></a> v1.9.0 Known issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- SCST - Store returns an expired certificate error message when a CA certificate expires before the app certificate. For more information, see [CA Cert expires](scst-store/troubleshooting.hbs.md#ca-cert-expires).

#### <a id='1-9-0-tdp-ki'></a>v1.9.0 Known issues: Tanzu Developer Portal - ScmAuth
[ScmAuth](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/integration-react.scmauth/) is a Backstage concept that abstracts Source Code Management (SCM) authentication into a package. An oversight in a recent codebase migration led to the accidental exclusion of custom ScmAuth functionality, affecting certain client operations such as creating Git repos on behalf of users via Application Accelerators. This issue is scheduled for correction in the next patch release.
