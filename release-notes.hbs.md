### <a id='1-4-3-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-4-3-grype-scanner-ri'></a> Grype Scanner

- **Updated Syft version to fix image scans failing with panic:**

   Syft was updated to fix an issue that causes the scanner to fail with an index out of range error.
   This happened when parsing APK metadata to identify the installed OS packages if a package's list of provided
   files is empty.

#### <a id='1-4-3-grype-scanner-ri'></a> Source Controller

- **Updated imgpkg API to v0.36.0 to fix Python function's revision:**

   The Revision was not getting generated for the Python function workload because of ProgressDeadlineExceeded. This led to ksvc revision not being generated and the app is inaccessible. This update fixes that problem.

---

### <a id='1-4-3-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-4-3-grype-scanner-ki'></a> Grype Scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager might not reveal
  vulnerabilities:**

  For most languages, source code scanning only scans files present in the
  source code repository. Except for support added for Java projects using
  Maven, no network calls fetch dependencies. For languages using dependency
  lock files, such as golang and Node.js, Grype uses the lock files to verify
  dependencies for vulnerabilities.

  For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
  dependencies present in the built binaries, such as `.jar` or `.war` files.

  Because VMware discourages committing binaries to source code repositories,
  Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan. The vulnerabilities
  are still found during the image scan after the binaries are built and
  packaged as images.

### <a id='1-4-2-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this
release.

#### <a id='1-4-2-tbs-ri'></a> Tanzu Build Service

- Fixed an issue that prevented the Cloud Native Buildpacks lifecycle component from
  upgrading with Tanzu Build Service.
  - Outdated lifecycle components can be built with older versions of Golang
    containing CVEs in the standard library.
  - Upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.4.2 ensures the lifecycle component is updated to
    the latest version.

### <a id='1-4-2-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-2-grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

  For most languages, source code scanning only scans files present in the
  source code repository. Except for support added for Java projects using

  Because VMware discourages committing binaries to source code repositories,
  Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan. The vulnerabilities
  are still found during the image scan after the binaries are built and
  packaged as images.

- **Scanning some Alpine-based container images fails with a panic:**

  An issue in Syft causes the scanner to crash with index out of range, while parsing APK metadata to identify installed OS packages if a package's list of provided files is empty.
  This problem is resolved in SCST - Scan (Grype) version `1.4.1` or in the Tanzu Application Platform version `1.5.0+`.

## <a id='1-4-1'></a> v1.4.1

**Release Date**: February 16, 2023

### <a id='1-4-1-security-fixes'></a> Security fixes

This release has the following security fixes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-1-tap-gui-sf"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- [GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc)
- [GHSA-36fh-84j7-cv5h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36fh-84j7-cv5h)

---

### <a id='1-4-1-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this
release.

#### <a id='1-4-1-src-controller-ri'></a> Source Controller

- Fixed an issue that caused some registries, including DockerHub, to incur
  higher than expected pulls because all HTTP GET calls are considered to be
  pulls. With this fix, HTTP requests use HEAD operations instead of GET
  operations, which reduces the number of pulls while checking updated image
  versions.

#### <a id='1-4-1-tap-gui-ri'></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Fixed SVG icons that appeared overly large on the sidebar.
- Added catalog graph cards and diagram defaults to align with upstream
  Backstage.

##### <a id="1-4-1-api-val-and-scor-ri"></a> API Validation and Scoring Toolkit plug-in

- Better error-handling for when a scoring value is missing in the API YAML.
- Adjusted some styles of the components to meet requirements.

##### <a id="1-4-1-app-acc-pi-ri"></a> Application Accelerator plug-in

- Fixed the rendering of options that share an identical `dependsOn` array
  value. Added system property configuration for the Git repository creation
  feature.
- Added a workflow scope to the Git repository creation feature.

##### <a id="1-4-1-app-live-view-pi-ri"></a> Application Live View plug-in

- Fixed the reset button in the root logger of the Application Live View log
  levels page.

##### <a id="1-4-1-sc-templates-pi-ri"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates plug-in

- Fixed deliverable content written into ConfigMaps in a multicluster setup.
  Added labels to attribute the deliverable content with the supply chain and
  the template. This was done to be consistent with the delivery on a non-Build
  profile cluster. For more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application
  Platform overview](multicluster/about.hbs.md).

##### <a id="1-4-1-sagui-pi-ri"></a> Security Analysis plug-in

- Updated the data model for the response of `metadata-store`.
- Changed the table's position on the index page.
- Updated the filter for workloads with no associated policy.
- Updated the bar graph for workloads with big and small values for different
  severities.
- Fixed a discrepancy between the widget and the information in **Workload Build
  Vulnerabilities**.

##### <a id="1-4-1-scc-resolved"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in

- The **Generation** box now shows the correct amended scan policy version.
  Clicking the scan policy link displays the amended policy.
- The **Approve a Request** button now appears in the **Stage Details** section
  of the Supply Chain view when the **Config Writer** stage is selected and the
  GitOps PR flow is configured.
- When an error occurs and the scan policy documentation link appears, the link
  now targets the latest version of the Tanzu Application Platform
  documentation.

##### <a id="1-4-1-scst-pi-ri"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools plug-in

- Fixed view approval failing to display in the **Config Writer** stage.
- Fixed the check box status in the Table filter.
- Updated the Scan policy documentation URL.
- Fixed the Generation number displayed after the scan policy is updated.

#### <a id="1-4-1-sa-gui-known-issues"></a>Security Analysis GUI

- After upgrading to Tanzu Application Platform v1.4 from v1.3, the Security
  Analysis GUI dashboard might appear empty because the dashboard now displays
  information from the Metadata Store. To repopulate the dashboard, see
  [Troubleshooting](tap-gui/troubleshooting.hbs.md#empty-dash-after-upgrade).

- Added new `ClassClaim` API that allows claims for service instances to be
  created by referring to a `ClusterInstanceClass`. For more information, see
  [When to use ClassClaim vs
  ResourceClaim](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/0.9/svc-tlk/resource_claims-which_claim.html)
  and [Introducing different service implementations in different
  environments](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/0.9/svc-tlk/usecases-introducing_different_service_implementations_in_different_environments.html).
- Added corresponding `tanzu services class-claims` CLI plug-in command.
- Added support for OpenShift v4.11.
- Added support for Kubernetes v1.25.
- All containers are now configured with read-only root file systems.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-nf"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI plug-ins

##### <a id='1-4-0-sagui-new-feats'></a>Security Analysis Plug-in

- **Understand the total number of affected packages and vulnerabilities on the
  Security Analysis Dashboard:** The Vulnerabilities by Severity widget and the
  Workload Build Vulnerabilities table have updated logic to count all CVEs and
  packages, providing a better idea of the discrete, affected packages.
  Previously, the logic counted unique CVEs, even if a particular CVE affected
  multiple packages.
- **Quickly identify all affected workloads for a specific CVE, package, or
  dependency:** The CVE and Package details pages include a new table that shows
  all affected workloads for a specific CVE or package. You access the CVE and
  Package details page on the source or image scan stage in the Supply Chain
  Choreographer Plug-in.

##### <a id='scc-plug-in-new-features'></a>Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in

- Events are now emitted when resources are applied and when their output or
  health status changes. See [Events reference](scc/events.hbs.md).
- Source Tester stage now includes a link to the Jenkins job when Jenkins is
  configured for use in the supply chain.
- `spec.source.git.url` is added to the Overview section of the Source Provider
  stage in the supply chain.
- Added support to include current and historical Kaniko build logs in the Stage
  Details section of the supply chain when Kaniko is used as the build service
  in the Image Provider stage.
- Scanning stages now include a `Show Unique CVEs` filter so that the scan
  results show one CVE per ID as opposed to each CVE per package. This allows
  better alignment between the data in the Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in
  and the Security Analysis plug-in.

#### <a id="1-4-0-scst-policy-new-features"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy

- Added ability to [configure action when no policy matches the admitting image
  digest](./scst-policy/install-scst-policy.hbs.md#install-scst-policy).
- Added ability to [allow empty authorities for
  ClusterImagePolicies](./scst-policy/install-scst-policy.hbs.md#install-scst-policy).
- Added ability to [specify which resources a ClusterImagePolicy should
  enforce](./scst-policy/configuring.hbs.md#cip-match).

#### <a id="1-4-0-scst-scan-new-features"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

- Users no longer need to create a package overlay to enable Grype in offline
  and air-gapped environments. See [Using Grype in offline and air-gapped
  environments](scst-scan/offline-airgap.hbs.md).
- Increased compatibility with customers' existing environments by supporting
  custom certificate authorities (CAs) by using the `tap-values.yml` for both
  Grype and Snyk scanners.
- Alpha release of Prisma Scanner integration. See [Install Prisma
  Scanner](scst-scan/install-prisma-integration.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-new-feat"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- The developer sandbox enables developers to Live Update their code and
  simultaneously debug the updated code, without having to deactivate Live
  Update when debugging.
- An Activity pane was added in the Tanzu Panel that allows developers
  to visualize the supply chain, delivery, and running application pods.
  It displays detailed error messages on each resource and enables developers to
  describe and view logs on these resources from within their IDE.
- Tanzu workload `apply` and `delete` actions were added to ​IntelliJ.
- Code snippets to create `workload.yaml` and `catalog-info.yaml` files were
  added to IntelliJ.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vs-new-features"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds:** By using Live Update
  facilitated by Tilt, deploy your workload once, save changes to the code, and
  then in seconds see those changes reflected in the workload running on the
  cluster. All Live Update output is filtered to its own output pane window
  within Visual Studio.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster:** Debug your application in a
  production-like environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster that has
  Tanzu Application Platform. An environment’s similarity to production relies
  on keeping dependencies updated, among other variables.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vscode-new-features"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- The developer sandbox enables developers to Live Update their code, and
  simultaneously debug the updated code, without having to deactivate Live
  Update when debugging.

### <a id='1-4-0-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-bc"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Removed
  `AuthServer.spec.identityProvider.ldap.group.search{Filter,Base,Depth,SubTree}`
  and introduced `ldap.group.search: {}`.
  - If `ldap.group` is defined and `ldap.group.search` is not defined, the LDAP
      is considered an ActiveDirectory style LDAP and groups are loaded from the
      user's `memberOf` attribute.
  - If `ldap.group` and `ldap.group.search` are both defined, the LDAP is
      considered a Classic LDAP and group search is done by searching in the
      `ldap.group.search.base`.
  - There used to be a mixed mode, when both searches were attempted every time.
- Removed `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.ldap.server` field.
- Removed
  `AuthServer.status.deployments.authServer.lastParentGenerationWithRestart`
  field.
- Removed deprecated field `AuthServer.spec.issuerURI`. For more information,
  see [IssuerURI and
  TLS](./app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-supply-chain-templates"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates

- In a multicluster setup, when a Deliverable is created on a Build profile
cluster, the ConfigMap it's in is renamed from `<workload-name>` to
`<workload-name>-deliverable`. Any automation that depends on obtaining the
Deliverable content by the former name must be updated with the new name. For
more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application Platform
overview](multicluster/about.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-ipw-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Image Policy Webhook

- The Image Policy Webhook component is removed in Tanzu Application Platform
v1.4. This component is deprecated in favor of the [Policy
Controller](./scst-policy/overview.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-policy-controller-bc"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller

- Policy Controller no longer initializes TUF by default. TUF is required to
support the keyless authorities in `ClusterImagePolicy`. To continue to use
keyless authorities, provide the value `policy.tuf_enabled: true` by using the
`tap-values.yaml` file while upgrading. By default, the public Sigstore The
Update Framework (TUF) server is used. To target an alternative Sigstore stack,
specify `policy.tuf_mirror` and `policy.tuf_root`.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-bc"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- **Ingress URL:** As mentioned in the [new features
  section](#1-4-0-tap-new-features), Tanzu Application Platform GUI participates
  in the shared ingress issuer feature. You might need to change your scheme
  from http to https. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](tap-gui/troubleshooting.hbs.md#catalog-not-loading).

- **Communication with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store:** In previous
  versions of Tanzu Application Platform, you configured Tanzu Application
  Platform GUI to use the read-only access token to communicate with Supply
  Chain Security Tools - Store.

  In v1.4, you must use the read-write access token to use new features in the
  Security Analysis GUI plug-in. If upgrading from v1.3, update your Tanzu
  Application Platform GUI configuration accordingly. See the updated
  instructions in [Enable CVE scan
  results](tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.hbs.md#scan).

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-bc"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- IntelliJ IDEA v2022.2 to v2022.3 is required to install the extension.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vscode-bc"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- `Tanzu Debug` no longer port forwards the application port (8080).

#### <a id="1-4-0-cve-2022-4378"></a> Note about CVE-2022-4378

- [CVE-2022-4378](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4378) is a high
  severity, exploitable stack overflow flaw found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL
  subsystem. At this time, there is no available patch from Canonical in their
  upstream Ubuntu distribution. Once there is a patch available for the 22.04
  release line, Tanzu Application Platform will release a patched base stack
  image. The current status for patching this vulnerability in the Jammy stack
  is available on [Ubuntu’s security
  page](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-4378). <br />

  It is important for customers to understand CVE-2022-4378 is a kernel exploit,
  and the kernel runs on the customers’ container host VM, not the Tanzu
  Application Platform container image. Even with a patched image, the
  vulnerability will not be mitigated until customers deploy their containers on
  a host with a patched OS. An unpatched host OS may be exploitable if the base
  image is deployed allowing users to modify SYSCTL parameters.

  RedHat has published a [potential
  mitigation](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-4378) preventing
  regular users from accessing sysctl files and increasing privileges until a
  patch becomes available.

### <a id='1-4-0-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this
release.

#### <a id="1-4-0-api-auto-registration-ri"></a> API Auto Registration

- API Auto Registration periodically checks the original API specification from
  the defined location to find changes and registers any changes into the `API
  Descriptor`. This triggers reconciliation into the Tanzu Application Platform
  GUI catalog. This synchronization period or frequency is configurable through
  the new value `sync_period`. The default value is 5 minutes.

#### <a id="1-4-0-appsso-ri"></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Fixed infinite redirect loops for an `AuthServer` configured with a single
  OIDC or SAML identity provider.
- Authorization Code request rejected audit event from anonymous users logging
  proper IP address.
- `AuthServer` no longer attempts to configure Redis event listeners.
- OpenShift: custom `SecurityContextConstraint` resource is created for
  Kubernetes platforms versions 1.23.x and lower.
- LDAP error log now contains proper error message.

#### <a id="1-4-0-supply-chain-templates-resolved"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates

Fixed deliverable content written into ConfigMaps in multicluster setup.
ConfigMap is renamed to avoid conflict with `config-template`.

For more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application Platform
overview](multicluster/about.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-apps-cli-plugin-ri"></a> Tanzu CLI Apps Plug-in

- Fixed `tanzu apps workload tail` command output, which was displaying extra
  init container log lines.
- Fixed `tanzu apps workload tail` command not including all logs.

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ri"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI plug-ins

- **Immediate entity provider back-end plug-in**

  - The entity provider, used mainly by API Auto Registration, now allows a body
    size of `5Mb` to accept larger API specifications.
  - Considering the restriction of Backstage for [Entity Provider
    mutations](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/external-integrations#provider-mutations),
    whenever an existing entity is intended for a mutation through this plug-in,
    and its origin is a different entity provider, a `409 Conflict` error is
    returned.

##### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ri"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in

- The UI no longer shows the error `Unable to retrieve details from Image
  Provider Stage` when the Builder is not available or configured. It now
  correctly shows the same error as the CLI, `Builder default is not ready`.
- Build logs are now displayed when the **Image Provider** stage fails

---

### <a id='1-4-0-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id="api-auto-registration-ki"></a> API Auto Registration

- Unknown Certificate Authority and connection refused errors from the
APIDescriptor CRD. For more information, see [Troubleshoot API Auto
Registration](api-auto-registration/troubleshooting.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-app-acc-vscode-ki"></a> Application Accelerator for Visual Studio Code

- When using custom types, if there is a check box in the list of attributes
  then re-ordering the inputs doesn't work.

#### <a id="1-4-0-cnr-ki"></a> Cloud Native Runtimes for VMware Tanzu

- Knative Serving: Certain app name, namespace, and domain combinations produce
  invalid HTTPProxy resources. See [Cloud Native Runtimes
  Troubleshooting](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.1/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes/GUID-troubleshooting.html#invalid-httpproxy).
- Knative Serving and Cert Manager: When auto-tls is enabled, the default in
  Tanzu Application Platform v1.4.0, Knative services fail with
  `certificateNotReady` if workload name, namespace, and domain are more than 64
  bytes. See [Cloud Native Runtimes
  Troubleshooting](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.1/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes/GUID-troubleshooting.html#certificate-not-ready).

#### <a id="1-4-0-grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager might not reveal
  vulnerabilities:**

  For most languages, Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the
  source code repository. Except for support added for Java projects using
  Maven, no network calls fetch dependencies. For languages using dependency
  lock files, such as Golang and Node.js, Grype uses the lock files to check
  dependencies for vulnerabilities.

  For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
  dependencies present in the built binaries, such as `.jar` or `.war` files.

  Because VMware discourages committing binaries to source code repositories,
  Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan. The vulnerabilities
  are still found during the image scan after the binaries are built and
  packaged as images.

- **Scanning some Alpine-based container images fails with a panic:**

  An issue in Syft causes the scanner to crash with index out of range, while parsing APK metadata to identify installed OS packages if a package's list of provided files is empty.
  This problem is resolved in SCST - Scan (Grype) version `1.4.1` or in the Tanzu Application Platform version `1.5.0+`.

#### <a id="1-4-0-nsp-ki"></a> Namespace Provisioner

- Applying the label selector used by the namespace provisioner controller to
  the developer namespace, which is configured at deployment time under the
  `grype` package values, will cause the [`provisioner` Carvel
  app](namespace-provisioner/about.hbs.md#nsp-component-carvel-app) to crash due
  to ownership issues. This is because it's trying to install Grype in a
  namespace where it's already been installed.

#### <a id="1-4-scc-ki"></a> Out of the Box Supply Chain Templates

In a Build profile cluster, Deliverables will be created with the labels to
associate them with their Workload missing. As a workaround, they will have to
be manually injected.  For more information, see [Multicluster Tanzu Application
Platform overview](../docs-tap/multicluster/about.hbs.md).

#### <a id="1-4-0-tap-gui-plugin-ki"></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI plug-ins

##### <a id="sec-analysis-plugin-ki"></a> Security Analysis plug-in

- The **No Associated Policy** tab in Workload Build Vulnerabilities does not
  show workloads that lack associated scan policies.
- The CVEs bar graph in Workload Build Vulnerabilities sometimes cuts numbers
  off.

##### <a id="supply-chain-plugin-ki"></a> Supply Chain Choreographer plug-in

- The `Generation` field and scan policy link in the **Overview** section does
  not update when you amend a scan policy. The correct version and details of
  the policy are shown in the CLI.
- Customizing the `Source Tester` stage in an Out Of the Box supply chain does
  not show details in the **Stage Details** section.
- When a GitOps PR flow is configured, the **Approve a Request** link no longer
  appears in the supply chain graph.

#### <a id="1-4-0-intellij-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- If a workload is deployed onto a namespace by using Live Update, you must set
  that namespace as the namespace of the current context of your kubeconfig
  file. Otherwise, if you run Tanzu Debug, it causes the workload to re-deploy.
  For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#debug-reapplies-apply).

- On macOS, Tanzu Panel might be empty when using a GKE cluster. For more
  information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#panel-empty-gke).

- The **Describe** action in the pop-up menu in the Activity panel can fail when
  used on PodIntent resources. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#describe-action-fail).

- The Tanzu panel might show workloads without showing Kubernetes resources in
  the center panel of the activity pane. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#tnz-panel-k8s-rsrc-fail).

- The Details table and Messages pane in the activity panel can show stale data
  because these views only refresh when the selection in the Resource tree is
  changed. As a workaround, make the views refresh by clicking somewhere in the
  Resource tree to change the current selection.

- Live Update does not work when using the Jammy `ClusterBuilder`. This is resolved in TAP `1.5.x` and later.

#### <a id="1-4-0-vs-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

- The `Tanzu: Delete Workload` command can fail with the extension erroneously
  reporting that the workload isn't running. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](vs-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#del-wrkld-not-running).

- The `Tanzu: Start Live Update` command can fail because the specified path was
  not found. For more information, see
  [Troubleshooting](vs-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#lv-update-path-not-found).

#### <a id="1-4-0-vscode-ki"></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- `Could not find the task 'tanzuManagement: Kill Port Forward
  fortune-service'`. You might see this error message if an app was deployed
  with a previous version of the Visual Studio Code extension. For more
  information, see
  [Troubleshooting](vscode-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#deprecated-task).

- Live Update does not work when using the Jammy `ClusterBuilder`. This is resolved in TAP `1.5.x` and later.
