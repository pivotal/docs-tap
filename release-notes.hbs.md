### <a id='1-5-0-new-component-features'></a> New features by component and area

#### <a id='1-5-0-app-accelerator-new-features'></a> Application Accelerator

- The Application Accelerator plug-in for IntelliJ is now available as a beta release on the [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform/).
- The [Tanzu Java Restful Web App](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/java-rest-service) and [Tanzu Java Web App](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/tanzu-java-web-app) accelerators have the option to support Spring Boot v3.0.
- Use the `accelerator-info.yaml` file to review historical information and to determine if
  a project was generated with an accelerator.
- (Optional) Use a system-wide property in the `tap-values.yaml` configuration file to activate or
  deactivate Git repository creation. For more information, see [Deactivate Git repository creation](./tap-gui/plugins/application-accelerator-git-repo.hbs.md#deactiv-git-repo-creation).

#### <a id='1-5-0-appsso-new-features'></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

- Introduces `AuthServer` CORS API that enables configuration of allowed HTTP origins.
  This is useful for public clients, such as single-page apps.
- Introduces an API for filtering external roles, groups, and memberships across OpenID, LDAP, and SAML identity providers
  in `AuthServer` resource into the `roles` claim of the resulting identity
  token. For more information, see [Roles claim filtering](app-sso/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md#roles-filters).
- Introduces mapping of users' roles, filtered and propagated in the identity
  token's `roles` claim, into scopes of the access token. For access tokens that are in the JWT format, the resulting
  scopes are part of the access token's `scope` claim, if the `ClientRegistration` contains the
  scopes. For more information, see [Configure authorization](app-sso/service-operators/configure-authorization.hbs.md).
- Introduces default access token scopes for user's authentication by using an identity
  provider. For more information, see [Default authorization scopes](app-sso/service-operators/configure-authorization.hbs.md#default-scopes).
- Introduces standardized client authentication methods to `ClientRegistration` custom resource.
  For more information, see [ClientRegistration](app-sso/crds/clientregistration.hbs.md).

#### <a id='1-5-0-services-toolkit-new-features'></a> Services Toolkit

- Services Toolkit now supports the dynamic provisioning of services instances.
  - `ClusterInstanceClass` now supports the new provisioner mode.
  When a `ClassClaim` is created which refers to a provisioner `ClusterInstanceClass`, a new
  service instance is created on-demand and claimed.
 This is powered by [Crossplane](crossplane/about.hbs.md).

- The `tanzu service` CLI plug-in has the following updates:
  - The command `tanzu service class-claim create`  now allows you to pass parameters to the
  provisioner-based `ClusterInstanceClass` to support dynamic provisioning.
  For example,
  `tanzu service class-claim create rmq-claim-1 --class rmq --parameter replicas=3  --parameter ha=true`
  - The `tanzu service class-claim get` now outputs parameters passed as part of claim creation.
  - For more information about these commands, see [Tanzu Service CLI Plug-In](services-toolkit/reference/tanzu-service-cli.hbs.md#stk-cli-class-claim).

- Services Toolkit integrates with the new component [Bitnami Services](bitnami-services/about.hbs.md),
  which provides pre-installed dynamic provisioning support for the following Helm charts:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL
  - Redis
  - RabbitMQ

- Improved the security model to control which users can claim specific service instances.
  - Introduced the `claim` custom RBAC verb that targets a specific `ClusterInstanceClass`.
  You can bind this to users for access control of who can create `ClassClaim` resources for
  a specific `ClusterInstanceClass`.
  - A `ResourceClaimPolicy` is now created automatically for successful `ClassClaims`.
  - For more information, see [Authorize users and groups to claim from provisioner-based classes](services-toolkit/how-to-guides/authorize-users-to-claim-from-provisioner-classes.hbs.md) to learn more.

- `ResourceClaimPolicy` now supports targeting individual resources by name.
  To do so, configure `.spec.subject.resourceNames`.

- The `Where-For-Dinner` sample application accelerator now supports dynamic provisioning.

- There are large changes to the Services Toolkit component documentation.
  - The [standalone Services Toolkit documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Services-Toolkit-for-VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/index.html)
  is no longer receiving updates.
  From now on you can find all Services Toolkit documentation in the Tanzu Application Platform
  component documentation section for [Services Toolkit](services-toolkit/about.hbs.md).
  - See the new [tutorials](services-toolkit/tutorials/index.hbs.md),
  [how-to guides](services-toolkit/how-to-guides/index.hbs.md),
  [concepts](services-toolkit/concepts/index.hbs.md), and
  [reference material](services-toolkit/reference/index.hbs.md) to learn more about working with services
  on Tanzu Application Platform.

#### <a id='1-5-0-scc-new-features'></a> Supply Chain Choreographer

- Introduces a variation of the OOTB Basic supply chains that output Carvel packages. Carvel packages enable configuring for each runtime environment. See [Carvel Package Workflow](scc/carvel-package-supply-chain.hbs.md). This feature is experimental.

#### <a id='1-5-0-scst-policy-new-features'></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller

- ClusterImagePolicy resync is triggered every 10 hours to get updated values from KMS.

#### <a id='1-5-0-external-secrets-new-features'></a>External Secrets CLI (Beta)
The external-secrets plug-in available in the Tanzu CLI interacts with the External Secrets Operator API. Users can use this CLI plug-in to create and view External Secrets Operator resources on a Kubernetes cluster.

Refer to the official [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io) documentation to learn
more about managing secrets with External Secrets in general. For installing the External Secrets 
Operator and the CLI plug-in refer to the following documentation. Additionally, refer to the example
integration of External-Secrets with Hashicorp Vault

- [Installing External Secrets Operator in TAP](external-secrets/install-external-secrets-operator.hbs.md)
- [Installing External Secrets CLI plug-in](prerequisites.hbs.md)
- [External-Secrets with Hashicorp Vault](external-secrets/vault-example.md)


#### <a id='1-5-0-cert-manager-ncf'></a> cert-manager

- `cert-manager.tanzu.vmware.com` has upgraded to cert-manager `v1.11.0`.
For more information, see [cert-manager GitHub repository](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/tag/v1.11.0).

#### <a id="1-5-0-scst-scan-features"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan
- SCST - Scan now runs on Tanzu Service Mesh-enabled clusters, enabling end to end, secure communication.
  - Kubernetes Jobs that previously created the scan pods were replaced with [Tekton TaskRuns](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/taskruns/#overview).
  - [Observability](./scst-scan/observing.hbs.md) and [Troubleshooting](./scst-scan/troubleshoot-scan.hbs.md) documentation is updated to account for the impact of these changes. One restart in scanner pods is expected with successful scans. See [Scanner Pod restarts once in SCST - Scan `v1.5.0` or later](./scst-scan/troubleshoot-scan.hbs.md#scanner-pod-restarts).
- In conformance with NIST 800-53, support for rotating certificates and TLS is added.
  - Users can specify a TLS certificate, minimum TLS version, and restrict TLS ciphers when using kube-rbac-proxy. See [Configure properties](./scst-scan/install-scst-scan.hbs.md#configure-scst-scan).
- SCST - Scan now offers even more flexibility for users to use their existing investments in scanning solutions. In Tanzu Application Platform `v1.5.0`, users have early access to:
  - A new alpha integration with the [Trivy Open Source Vulnerability Scanner](https://www.aquasec.com/products/trivy/) by Aqua Security scans source code and images from secure supply chains. See [Install Trivy (alpha)](./scst-scan/install-trivy-integration.hbs.md).
  - A simplified alpha user experience for creating custom integrations with additional vulnerability scanners that aren't included by default. Got a scanner that you'd like to use with Tanzu Application Platform? See [Supply Chain Security Tools - App Scanning](./scst-scan/app-scanning-alpha.hbs.md).
  - The Tanzu team is looking for early adopters to test drive both of these alpha offerings and provide feedback. Email your Tanzu representative or [contact us here](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-platform).
- Carbon Black Scanner - **Update carbon black scanner CLI to version 1.9.2**
  - Add BuildPack cyclonedx support:

    when scanning image that was created by BuildPack add package from the create and build image to scan manifest.
  - Update scan logic to reduce scan time.

#### <a id='1-5-0-breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id='1-5-0-tbs-bc'></a> Tanzu Build Service

- The default `ClusterBuilder` now uses the Ubuntu Jammy v22.04 stack instead of the Ubuntu Bionic
v18.04 stack. Previously, the default `ClusterBuilder` pointed to the Base builder based on the
Bionic stack. Now, the default `ClusterBuilder` points to the Base builder based on the Jammy stack.
Ensure that your workloads can be built and run on Jammy.

  For information about how to change the `ClusterBuilder` from the default builder, see the
  [Configure the Cluster Builder](../docs-tap/tanzu-build-service/tbs-workload-config.hbs.md#cluster-builder) in the Tanzu Build Service documentation.

  For more information about available builders, see
  [Lite Dependencies](../docs-tap/tanzu-build-service/dependencies.hbs.md#lite-dependencies) and
  [Full Dependencies](../docs-tap/tanzu-build-service/dependencies.hbs.md#full-dependencies) in the
  Tanzu Build Service documentation.

#### <a id='1-5-0-security-fixes'></a> Security fixes

This release has the following security fixes, listed by area and component.

#### <a id='1-5-0-resolved-issues'></a> Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by area and component, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-5-0-app-accelerator-resolved-issues'></a> Application Accelerator

- Resolved issue with `custom types` not re-ordering fields correctly in the VS Code extension.

#### <a id='1-5-0-appsso-resolved-issues'></a> Application Single Sign-On (AppSSO)

(TKGm) clusters.

### <a id='1-5-0-known-issues'></a> Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by area and component.

#### <a id='1-5-0-cnrs-ki'></a> Cloud Native Runtimes

- When using auto-tls, on by default, DomainMapping resources must have names that are less than 63 characters. Otherwise, the DomainMapping fails to become ready due to `CertificateNotReady`.

#### <a id='1-5-0-vscode-plugin-ki'></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for VS Code

- If a user restarts their computer while running Live Update, without having terminated the Tilt
  process beforehand, there is a lock that incorrectly shows that Live Update is still running and
  prevents it from starting again. Delete the Tilt lock file to resolve this.
  The default file location is `~/.tilt-dev/config.lock`.

- On Windows, workload commands don't work when in a project with spaces in the name, such as
  `my-app project`.
  For more information, see [Troubleshooting](vscode-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#projects-with-spaces).

- If your kubeconfig file (`~/.kube/config`) is malformed, you cannot apply a workload.
  You see an error message when you attempt to do so. To resolve this, fix the kubeconfig file.

- In the Tanzu Activity Panel, the `config-writer-pull-requester` of type `Runnable` is incorrectly
  categorized as **Unknown**. It should be in the **Supply Chain** category.

#### <a id='1-5-0-intellij-plugin-ki'></a> Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- A `com.vdurmont.semver4j.SemverException: Invalid version (no major version)` error is shown in the
  error logs when attempting to take a workload action before having installed the Tanzu CLI apps
  plug-in.

- The apply action prompts and stores the workload file path when using the action for the first time,
  but modifying it afterwards is not possible.
  If the workload file location changes, the user needs to delete the module's key-value entries
  prefixed with `com.tanzu` in the `PropertiesComponent` found in the project's `.idea/workspace.xml`
  file to delete the configuration. The next apply action run prompts for new values again.

- If a user restarts their computer while running Live Update without having terminated the Tilt
  process beforehand, there is a lock that incorrectly shows that Live Update is still running and
  prevents it from starting again.
  Deleting the Tilt lock file resolves this. The default location is `~/.tilt-dev/config.lock`.

- On Windows, workload actions do not work when in a project with spaces in the name such as
  `my-app project`.
  For more information, see [Troubleshooting](intellij-extension/troubleshooting.hbs.md#projects-with-spaces).

- In the Tanzu Activity Panel, the `config-writer-pull-requester` of type `Runnable` is incorrectly
  categorized as **Unknown**. It should be in the **Supply Chain** category.

#### <a id="1-5-0-grype-scan-known-issues"></a>Grype scanner

- **Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager might not reveal
  vulnerabilities:**

  For most languages, source code scanning only scans files present in the
  source code repository. Except for support added for Java projects using
  Maven, no network calls fetch dependencies. For languages using dependency
  lock files, such as golang and Node.js, Grype uses the lock files to verify
  dependencies for vulnerabilities.

  For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
  dependencies present in the built binaries, such as `.jar` or `.war` files.

  Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a source scan because VMware
  discourages committing binaries to source code repositories. The
  vulnerabilities are still found during the image scan after the binaries are
  built and packaged as images.

#### <a id='1-5-0-tap-gui-ki'></a> Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- The portal might partially overlay text on the Security Banners customization (bottom banner).

- The Impacted Workloads table is empty on the **CVE and Package Details** pages if the relevant CVE
  belongs to a workload that has only completed one type of vulnerability scan (either image or source).
  A fix is planned for Tanzu Application Platform GUI v1.5.1.
