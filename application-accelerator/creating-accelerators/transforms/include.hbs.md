# Include transform

This topic tells you about the Application Accelerator `Include` transform in Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

The `Include` transform retains files based on their `path`, letting in _only_ those files
whose path matches at least one of the configured `patterns`.
The contents of files, and any of their other characteristics, are unaffected.

`Include` is a basic building block seldom used as is, which
makes sense if composed inside a [Chain](chain.md) or a [Merge](merge.md).
It is often more convenient to leverage the shorthand notation offered
by [Combo](combo.md).
