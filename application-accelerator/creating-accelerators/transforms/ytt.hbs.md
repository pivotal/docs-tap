# YTT transform

This topic tells you about the Application Accelerator `YTT` transform in Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

The `YTT` transform starts the [YTT](https://carvel.dev/ytt/) template engine as
an external process.

## <a id="syntax-ref"></a>Syntax reference

```yaml
type: YTT
extraArgs: # optional
  - <SPEL-EXPRESSION-1>
  - <SPEL-EXPRESSION-2>
  - ...
```

The `YTT` transform's YAML notation does not require any parameters.
When invoked without parameters, which is the typical use case, the YTT transform's
input is determined entirely by two things only:

1. The input files fed into the transform.
2. The current values for options and derived symbols.

## <a id="execution"></a>Execution

YTT is invoked as an external process with the following command line:

```
ytt -f <input-folder> \
    --data-values-file <symbols.json> \
    --output-files <output-folder> \
    <extra-args>
```

The `<input-folder>` is a temporary directory into which the input files are "materialized." That is, the set of files passed to the YTT transform as input is written out into this directory to allow the YTT process to read them.

The `<symbols.json>` file is a temporary JSON file, which the current
option values and derived symbols are materialized in the form of a JSON map.
This allows YTT templates in the `<input-folder>` to make use of these symbols
during processing.

The `<output-folder>` is a fresh temporary directory that is empty at the time of invocation.
In a typical scenario, upon completion, the output directory contains files generated
by YTT.

The `<extra-args>` are additional command line arguments obtained by evaluating the
SPEL expressions from the `extraArgs` attribute.

When the `ytt` process completes with a 0 exit code, this is considered a successful execution and the contents of the output directory is taken to be the result of the YTT transform.

When the `ytt` process completes with a non 0 exit code, the
execution of the `YTT` transform is considered to have failed and
an exception is raised.

### <a id="basic-invocation"></a>Basic invocation

When you want to execute `ytt` on the contents of the entire accelerator repository, use the YTT transform as your only transform in the engine declaration.

```yaml
accelerator:
  ...
engine:
  type: YTT
```

To do anything beyond calling YTT, compose YTT into your accelerator flow using merge or chain combinators.
This is exactly the same as composing any other type of transform.

For example, when you want to define some derived symbols as well as merge the results from YTT with results from other parts of your accelerator transform, you can reference this example:

```yaml
engine:
  let: # Define derived symbols visible to all transforms (including YTT)
  - name: theAnswer
    expression: "41 + 1"
  merge:
  - include: ["deploy/**.yml"] # select some yaml files to process with YTT
    chain: # Chain selected yaml files to YTT
    - type: YTT
  - ... include/generate other stuff to be merged alongside yaml generated by YTT...
```

The preceding example uses a combination of [Chain](chain.md) and [Merge](merge.md).
You can use either `Merge` or `Chain` or both to compose YTT into
your accelerator flow. Which one you choose depends on how you want to use YTT as
part of your larger accelerator.

### <a id="using-extraargs"></a>Using `extraArgs`

The `extraArgs` passes additional command line arguments to
YTT. This adds file marks. See [File Marks](https://carvel.dev/ytt/docs/latest/file-marks/#available-marks) in the Carvel documentation.

For example, the following runs YTT and renames the `foo/demo.yml` file in its output to `bar/demo.yml`.

```yaml
engine:
  type: YTT
  extraArgs: ["'--file-mark'",  "'foo/demo.yml:path=bar/demo.yml'"]
```

The `extraArgs` attribute expects SPEL expressions. Take
care to use proper escaping of literal strings using double and single quotes
(that is, `"'LITERAL-STRING'").
