# Composition

This topic tells you how to use fragments in Application Accelerator.
## <a id="composition-intro"></a> Introduction

Despite their benefits, writing and maintaining, accelerators can become repetitive and
verbose as new accelerators are added. Some create a project different from the next
with similar aspects, requiring some form of copy-paste.

To alleviate this concern, Application Accelerators support a feature named Composition
that allows the re-use of parts of an accelerator, called **fragments**.

## <a id="introducting-fragments"></a> Introducing fragments

A **fragment** looks exactly the same as an accelerator:

- It is made of a set of files.
- It contains an `accelerator.yaml` descriptor with options, declarations, and a root transform.

There are differences however. Namely:

- Fragments are declared to the system differently. They are filed as **fragment** custom resources.
- They deal with files differently. Because fragments deal with their own files and files from the
accelerator using them, they use dedicated conflict resolution
[strategies](transforms/conflict-resolution.md) (more on this later).

Fragments may be thought of as "functions" in programming languages. After being defined and
referenced, they are "called" at various points in the main accelerator.
The composition feature is designed with ease of use and "common use first"
in mind, so these "functions" are typically called with as little noise as possible.
You can also call them complex or different values.

Composition relies on two building blocks that play hand in hand:

- The `imports` section at the top of an accelerator manifest.
- The, `InvokeFragment` transform, to be used alongside any other transform.

## <a id="imports-section-explained"></a>| The `imports` section explained

To be usable in composition, a fragment MUST be _imported_ into the dedicated
section of an accelerator manifest:

```yaml
accelerator:
  name: my-awesome-accelerator
  options:
    - name: flavor
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: Strawberry
  imports:
    - name: my-first-fragment
    - name: another-fragment
engine:
  ...
```

The effect of importing a fragment this way is twofold:

- It makes its files available to the engine (therefore importing a fragment is required).
- It exposes all of its options as options of the accelerator as if they were defined
  by the accelerator itself.

So in the earlier example, if the `my-first-fragment` fragment had the following `accelerator.yaml` file:

```yaml
accelerator
  name: my-first-fragment
  options:
    - name: optionFromFragment
      dataType: boolean
      description: this option comes from the fragment
...
```

Then it is as if the `my-awesome-accelerator` accelerator defined it:

```yaml
accelerator:
  name: my-awesome-accelerator
  options:
    - name: flavor
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: Strawberry
    - name: optionFromFragment
      dataType: boolean
      description: this option comes from the fragment
  imports:
    - name: my-first-fragment
    - name: another-fragment
engine:
  ...
```

All the metadata about options (type, default value, description, choices if applicable, _etc._) come
along when imported.

Because of this, users are prompted for a value for those options that come
from fragments, as if they were options of the accelerator.

## <a id="using-invokfrag-transform"></a> Using the `InvokeFragment` Transform

The second part at play in the composition is the `InvokeFragment` Transform.

As with any other transform, it may be used anywhere in the `engine` tree and
receives files that are "visible" at that point. Those files, alongside those
that make up the fragment, are made available to the fragment logic. If the fragment
wants to choose between two versions of a file for a path, two new conflict
resolution [strategies](transforms/conflict-resolution.md) are available: `FavorForeign` and `FavorOwn`.

The behavior of the `InvokeFragment` transform is very straightforward: after having validated
options that the fragment expects (and maybe after having set default values for
options that support one), it executes the whole transform of the fragment _as if
it was written in place of `InvokeFragment`_.

See the `InvokeFragment` [reference page](transforms/invoke-fragment.md) for more explanations,
examples, and configuration options. This topic now focuses on additional features of the `imports`
section that are seldom used but still available to cover more complex use cases.

## <a id="back-to-imports"></a> Back to the `imports` section

The complete definition of the `imports` section is as follows, with
features in increasing order of "complexity":

```yaml
accelerator:
  name: ...
  options:
    - name: ...
    ...
  imports:
    - name: some-fragment

    - name: another-fragment
      expose:
        - name: "*"
      exposeTypes:
        - name: "*"

    - name: yet-another-fragment
      expose:
        - name: someOption

        - name: someOtherOption
          as: aDifferentName
      exposeType:
        - name: SomeType

        - name: SomeOtherType
          as: ADifferentName
engine:
  ...
```

As shown earlier, the `imports` section calls a list of fragments to import. By default,
all their options and types become options/type of the accelerator. Those options appear _after_
the options defined by the accelerator, in the order the fragments are imported in.

It is even possible for a fragment to import another fragment, the semantics
being the same as when an accelerator imports a fragment. This is a way to
break apart a fragment even further if needed.

When importing a fragment, you can select which options of the fragment
to make available as options of the accelerator. **This feature should only be used
when a name clash arises in option names.**

The semantics of the `expose` block are as follows:

- For every `name`/`as` pair, don't use the original (`name`) of the
  option but instead, use the alias (`as`). Other metadata about the option
  is left unchanged.
- If the special `name: "*"` (which is NOT a legit option name usually) appears,
 all imported option names that are not remapped (the index at which the
  `*` appears in the YAML list is irrelevant) might be exposed
  with their original name.
- The default value for `expose` is `[{name: "*"}]`, that is, by default
  exposes all options with their original name.
- As soon as a single remap rule appears, the default is overridden. For example,
  to override some names AND expose the others unchanged, the `*` must
  be explicitly re-added.
- To explicitly un-expose ALL options from an imported fragment, an empty array may
  be used and overrides the default: `expose: []`.

Similarly, you can also select which [custom types](custom-types.hbs.md) of the fragment
to make available as types of the accelerator. **This feature should only be used
when a name clash arises in types names.**

The semantics of the `exposeTypes` block are as follows:

- For every `name`/`as` pair, don't use the original (`name`) of the
  type but instead, use the alias (`as`). Options that used the original
  name are automatically "rewritten" to use the new name.
- If the special `name: "*"` appears, which is NOT usually a legit type name,
  all imported other type names that are not remapped are exposed
  with their original name. The index at which the
  `*` appears in the YAML list is irrelevant.
- The default value for `exposeTypes` is `[{name: "*"}]`, that is, by default
  exposes all types with their original name.
- As soon as a single remap rule appears, the default is overridden. For example,
  to override some names AND expose the others unchanged, the `*` must
  be explicitly re-added.
- To explicitly un-expose ALL types from an imported fragment, an empty array may
  be used, which overrides the default: `exposeTypes: []`.

### <a id="using-dependsOn-in-import"></a> Using `dependsOn` in the `imports` section

Lastly, as a convenience for the conditional use of fragments, you can make an exposed imported
option _depend on_ another option, as in the following example:

```yaml
  imports:
    - name: tap-initialize
      expose:
        - name: gitRepository
          as: gitRepository
          dependsOn:
            name: deploymentType
            value: workload
        - name: gitBranch
          as: gitBranch
          dependsOn:
            name: deploymentType
            value: workload
```

This plays well with the use of `condition`, as in the following example:

```yaml
...
engine:
  ...
    type: InvokeFragment
    condition: "#deploymentType == 'workload'"
    reference: tap-initialize```
```

## <a id="cli-fragments"></a> Discovering fragments using Tanzu CLI accelerator plug-in

Using the accelerator plug-in for Tanzu CLI, you can view a list of available fragments. Run:

```console
tanzu accelerator fragment list
```

To see a list of available accelerator fragments. For example:

```console
NAME                                 READY   REPOSITORY
app-sso-client                       true    source-image: dev.registry.tanzu.vmware.com/app-accelerator/fragments/app-sso-client@sha256:ed5cf5544477d52d4c7baf3a76f71a112987856e77558697112e46947ada9241

```

The `tanzu accelerator fragment get <fragment-name>` command shows all the options defined for the
fragment and also any accelerators or other fragments that import this fragment. Run:

```console
tanzu accelerator fragment get java-version
```

The following output is displayed:

```console

- choices:
  - text: Java 8
    value: "1.8"

This shows the `options` and `importedBy` with a list of three accelerators that import this fragment.

Correspondingly, the `tanzu accelerator get <accelerator-name>` shows the fragments that an
accelerator imports. Run:

```console
tanzu accelerator get java-rest-service
```

The following output is shown:

```console

The `imports` section at the end shows the fragments that this accelerator imports. The `options`
section shows all options defined for this accelerator. This includes all options defined in the
imported fragments, for example, the options for the Java version imported from the `java-version`
fragment.
