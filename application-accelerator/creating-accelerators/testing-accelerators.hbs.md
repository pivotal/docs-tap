# Testing accelerators

This topic tells you how to test an updated accelerator, or fragment that is not registered in
your Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) cluster.

## <a id="accel-rapid-iteration"></a>Generating a project from local sources

When you are authoring your accelerator, you can test it before committing any changes.

With the `tanzu accelerator generate-from-local` command, you can run your accelerator (or
fragment), including any changes you have locally, specify a set of options and view the
generated project.

You can run the accelerator using the components on your Tanzu Application Platform cluster,
without impacting the state of the Tanzu Application Platform cluster.

To do so, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

  - The Tanzu CLI is installed, with the Application Accelerator plug-in. For details about installing
    the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins, see [Tanzu CLI](../../cli-plugins/tanzu-cli.md).
  - The server URL is pointing to the Tanzu Application Platform cluster you want to test with.
    For details about setting the server URL, see [Application Accelerator CLI plug-in overview](../../cli-plugins/accelerator/overview.md).

For example, to use the accelerator that is located at the path `workspace/java-rest`:

```console
tanzu accelerator generate-from-local --accelerator-path java-rest=workspace/java-rest --fragment-names tap-workload,java-version --options '{"projectName":"test"}' --output-dir generated-project
```

This generates the project in the local directory `generated-project`, using the
accelerator located at `workspace/java-rest`, the fragments `tap-workload` and
`java-version` which are assumed to be already registered in the Tanzu Application Platform cluster and the
option `projectName` set to `test`.

For example, to use the fragment named `java-version` that is located at the path `workspace/version`:

```console
tanzu accelerator generate-from-local --accelerator-name java-rest --fragment-paths java-version=workspace/version --fragment-names tap-workload --options '{"projectName":"test"}' --output-dir generated-project
```

This generates the project in the local directory `generated-project`,
using the accelerator `java-rest` and the fragment `tap-workload` which are assumed to be
already registered in the Tanzu Application Platform cluster, the fragment named `java-version`
located at `workspace/version`, and the option `projectName` set to `test`.

For the full documentation for the `generate-from-local` command, see reference [Tanzu accelerator generate-from-local](../../cli-plugins/accelerator/command-reference/tanzu_accelerator_generate_from_local.hbs).

No changes are made to the Tanzu Application Platform cluster that is provided with the
server URL. No new accelerators/fragments are registered or modified.
A Tanzu Application Platform cluster is required to ensure that there is consistency between the
version that is used for testing and the version that is used when the accelerator is registered.
Furthermore, it allows using registered fragments and accelerators as dependencies for the local
accelerator/fragment.

## <a id="creating-accel-ci-cd-pl"></a>CI/CD Pipeline
As you iterate on an accelerator, you can have some automated assertions run before any
changes to the accelerator are accepted.

The process for generating a project from the committed source files is the same as described earlier.

When the generated project is available, you can run various assertions on it:
```console
cd generated-project
test -f build.gradle
./gradlew test
```

If you have multiple assertions, you might choose to run a predefined script:
```console
cd generated-project
../assertions/validate-generate-project.sh
```

You might choose to generate multiple projects from the same accelerator, providing different
options for each and running different assertions on each generated project.

### <a id="tanzu-cli-in-ci-cd"></a>(Optional) Getting the Tanzu CLI in a CI/CD pipeline

If the Tanzu CLI is already available in your CI/CD pipeline you can skip this section.

VMware provides an example script that is agnostic to the CI/CD system it is running on.
The script requires a variable named `TANZU_REFRESH_TOKEN` which holds a personal
VMware Tanzu Network refresh token. To generate such a token see
[How to Authenticate](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/docs/api#how-to-authenticate).
The script also uses `curl` and `jq`.

The script downloads artifacts compatible with Tanzu Application Platform version v1.4 and a Linux operating
system. Update the script to suit the Tanzu Application Platform version and OS that you are using.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get access token using personal Tanzu Network refresh token
# See https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/docs/api#how-to-authenticate
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/authentication/access_tokens -d '{"refresh_token":"'"$TANZU_REFRESH_TOKEN"'"}' | jq -r ".access_token")
