# Install Tanzu Application Platform View profile

This topic tells you how to install View profile cluster by using a reduced values file.

The following is the YAML file sample for the view-profile:

```yaml
profile: view
ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.

shared:
  ingress_domain: "INGRESS-DOMAIN"
  kubernetes_distribution: "openshift" # To be passed only for Openshift. Defaults to "".
  kubernetes_version: "K8S-VERSION"
  ca_cert_data: | # To be passed if using custom certificates.
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIFXzCCA0egAwIBAgIJAJYm37SFocjlMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBDQUAMEY...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer # NodePort can be used if your Kubernetes cluster doesn't support LoadBalancing.

tap_gui:
  app_config:
    auth:
      allowGuestAccess: true  # This allows unauthenticated users to log in to your portal. If you want to deactivate it, make sure you configure an alternative auth provider.
    catalog:
      locations:
        - type: url
          target: https://GIT-CATALOG-URL/catalog-info.yaml
    kubernetes:
      serviceLocatorMethod:
        type: 'multiTenant'
      clusterLocatorMethods:
        - type: 'config'
          clusters:
            - url: CLUSTER-URL
              name: CLUSTER-NAME # Build profile cluster can go here.
              authProvider: serviceAccount
              serviceAccountToken: CLUSTER-TOKEN
              skipTLSVerify: TRUE-OR-FALSE-VALUE
            - url: CLUSTER-URL
              name: CLUSTER-NAME # Run profile cluster can go here.
              authProvider: serviceAccount
              serviceAccountToken: CLUSTER-TOKEN
              skipTLSVerify: TRUE-OR-FALSE-VALUE

appliveview:
  ingressEnabled: true

tap_telemetry:
  customer_entitlement_account_number: "CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" # (Optional) Identify data for creating Tanzu Application Platform usage reports.
```

Where:

- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's external IP address.
- `K8S-VERSION` is the Kubernetes version used by your OpenShift cluster. It must be in the form of `1.23.x` or `1.24.x`, where `x` stands for the patch version. Examples:
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.10 uses the Kubernetes version `1.23.3`.
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.11 uses the Kubernetes version `1.24.1`.
- `GIT-CATALOG-URL` is the path to the `catalog-info.yaml` catalog definition file. You can download either a blank or populated catalog file from the [Tanzu Application Platform product page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-application-platform/#/releases/1239018). Otherwise, use a Backstage-compliant catalog you've already built and posted on the Git infrastructure in the Integration section.
- `CLUSTER-URL`, `CLUSTER-NAME` and `CLUSTER-TOKEN` are described in the [View resources on multiple clusters in Tanzu Developer Portal](../../tap-gui/cluster-view-setup.md). Observe the [order of operations](../installing-multicluster.md#order-of-operations) laid out in the previous steps.
- `CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER` (optional) refers to the Entitlement Account Number (EAN), which is a unique identifier VMware assigns to its customers. Tanzu Application Platform telemetry uses this number to identify data that belongs to a particular customers and prepare usage reports. See the [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-cluster-lifecycle-ceip.html#identify-the-entitlement-account-number-2) for more information about identifying the Entitlement Account Number.

If you use custom CA certificates, you must provide one or more PEM-encoded CA certificates under the `ca_cert_data` key. If you configured `shared.ca_cert_data`, Tanzu Application Platform component packages inherit that value by default.

The `appliveview.ingressEnabled` key is set to `false` by default. In a multicluster setup, `ingressEnabled` key must be set to `true`. If the `shared.ingress_domain` key is set, the Application Live View back end is automatically exposed through the shared ingress.
