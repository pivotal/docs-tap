# Iterate profile

The following is the YAML file sample for the iterate-profile:

```yaml
profile: iterate

shared:
  ingress_domain: "INGRESS-DOMAIN"
  kubernetes_distribution: "openshift" # To be passed only for OpenShift. Defaults to "".
  kubernetes_version: "K8S-VERSION"
  image_registry:
    project_path: "SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME" # To be used by Build Service by appending "/buildservice" and used by Supply chain by appending "/workloads"
    secret:
      name: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET"
      namespace: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET-NAMESPACE"
  ca_cert_data: | # To be passed if using custom certificates

ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.

# The above shared keys may be overridden in the below section.

```

Where:

- `K8S-VERSION` is the Kubernetes version used by your OpenShift cluster. It must be in the form of `1.23.x` or `1.24.x`, where `x` stands for the patch version. Examples:
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.10 uses the Kubernetes version `1.23.3`.
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.11 uses the Kubernetes version `1.24.1`.
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Examples:
    - Harbor has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`.
    - Docker Hub has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `kp_default_repository: "index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`.
    - Google Cloud Registry has the form `kp_default_repository: "gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`.
    - For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account JSON file.
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET` is the user name that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential.
    - For Google Cloud Registry, use `kp_default_repository_username: _json_key`.
    - You must create the secret before the installation. For example, you can use the `registry-credentials` secret created earlier.
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-SECRET` is created.
- `SERVER-NAME` is the host name of the registry server. Examples:
    - Harbor has the form `server: "my-harbor.io"`.
    - Docker Hub has the form `server: "index.docker.io"`.
    - Google Cloud Registry has the form `server: "gcr.io"`.
- `REPO-NAME` is where workload images are stored in the registry.
Images are written to `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME/workload-name`. Examples:
    - Harbor has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`.
    - Docker Hub has the form `repository: "my-dockerhub-user"`.
    - Google Cloud Registry has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`.
- `SSH-SECRET-KEY` is the SSH secret key in the developer namespace for the supply chain to fetch source code from and push configuration to. See [Git authentication](../../scc/git-auth.hbs.md) for more information.
- `TAP-ITERATE-CNRS-DOMAIN` is the iterate cluster CNRS domain.
- `VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain you setup on the View profile cluster. This matches the value key `appliveview.ingressDomain` or `shared.ingress_domain` on the view cluster. Include the default host name `appliveview.` ahead of the domain.
- `CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER` (optional) refers to the Entitlement Account Number (EAN), which is a unique identifier VMware assigns to its customers. Tanzu Application Platform telemetry uses this number to identify data that belongs to a particular customers and prepare usage reports. See the [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-cluster-lifecycle-ceip.html#identify-the-entitlement-account-number-2) for more information about identifying the Entitlement Account Number.

If you use custom CA certificates, you must provide one or more PEM-encoded CA certificates under the `ca_cert_data` key. If you configured `shared.ca_cert_data`, Tanzu Application Platform component packages inherit that value by default.

If you set `shared.ingress_domain` in the iterate profile, the `appliveview_connector.backend.host` is automatically configured as `host: appliveview.INGRESS-DOMAIN`. To override the shared ingress for Application Live View to connect to the view cluster, set the `appliveview_connector.backend.host` key to `appliveview.VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN`.
