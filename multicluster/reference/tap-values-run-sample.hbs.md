# Install Tanzu Application Platform Run profile

This topic tells you how to install Run profile cluster by using a reduced values file.

The following is the YAML file sample for the run-profile:

```yaml
profile: run
ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.

shared:
  ingress_domain: INGRESS-DOMAIN
  kubernetes_distribution: "openshift" # To be passed only for Openshift. Defaults to "".
  kubernetes_version: "K8S-VERSION"
  ca_cert_data: | # To be passed if using custom certificates.
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIFXzCCA0egAwIBAgIJAJYm37SFocjlMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBDQUAMEY...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
supply_chain: basic

contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer # NodePort can be used if your Kubernetes cluster doesn't support LoadBalancing.

appliveview_connector:
  backend:
    sslDeactivated: TRUE-OR-FALSE-VALUE
    ingressEnabled: true
    host: appliveview.VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN

tap_telemetry:
  customer_entitlement_account_number: "CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" # (Optional) Identify data for creating Tanzu Application Platform usage reports.

amr:
  observer:
    auth:
      kubernetes_service_accounts:
        enable: true
    cloudevent_handler:
      endpoint: https://amr-cloudevent-handler.VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN # AMR CloudEvent Handler location at the View profile cluster.
    ca_cert_data: |
        "AMR-CLOUDEVENT-HANDLER-CA" 
```

Where:

- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's external IP address.
- `K8S-VERSION` is the Kubernetes version used by your OpenShift cluster. It must be in the form of `1.23.x` or `1.24.x`, where `x` stands for the patch version. Examples:
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.10 uses the Kubernetes version `1.23.3`.
    - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.11 uses the Kubernetes version `1.24.1`.
- `VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain you setup on the View profile cluster. This matches the value key `appliveview.ingressDomain` or `shared.ingress_domain` on the view cluster. Include the default host name `appliveview.` ahead of the domain.
- `CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER` (optional) refers to the Entitlement Account Number (EAN), which is a unique identifier VMware assigns to its customers. Tanzu Application Platform telemetry uses this number to identify data that belongs to a particular customers and prepare usage reports. See the [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-cluster-lifecycle-ceip.html#identify-the-entitlement-account-number-2) for more information about identifying the Entitlement Account Number.
- `AMR-CLOUDEVENT-HANDLER-CA` contains the AMR CloudEvent Handler CA data. For more information about configuring the `amr` portion of the values file, see [Set up multicluster Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Store](../../scst-store/multicluster-setup.hbs.md).

If you use custom CA certificates, you must provide one or more PEM-encoded CA certificates under the `ca_cert_data` key. If you configured `shared.ca_cert_data`, Tanzu Application Platform component packages inherit that value by default.

If you set `shared.ingress_domain` in run profile, the `appliveview_connector.backend.host` is automatically configured as `host: appliveview.INGRESS-DOMAIN`. To override the shared ingress for Application Live View to connect to the view cluster, set the `appliveview_connector.backend.host` key to `appliveview.VIEW-CLUSTER-INGRESS-DOMAIN`.
