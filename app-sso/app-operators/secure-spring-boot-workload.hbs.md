# Secure a workload

This topic describes the procedures to add an authentication mechanism to a sample Spring Boot application 
by using AppSSO, which runs on Tanzu Application Platform (TAP). 
The [source code](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/appsso-starter-java) 
is available in GitHub. To follow along, you must clone the Git repository into your local development workspace.

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, please ensure that the following items are addressed:

- **RECOMMENDED** Familiarity with [Workloads and AppSSO](../register-an-app-with-app-sso.md#workloads)
- Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) `v1.2.0` or above is available and fully reconciled in your cluster.
    - Please ensure that you are using one of the following TAP Profiles: `run`, `iterate`, or `full`.
- AppSSO package is available and reconciled successfully on your cluster.
- AppSSO has at least one [identity provider configured](../../service-operators/identity-providers.md).
- Access to [AppSSO Starter Java accelerator](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/appsso-starter-java).

## Getting started

> **Note** See [Deploying the sample application as a Workload](#deploy-as-workload) for step-by-step instructions if you are already familiar
with the accelerator described in this tutorial.

### Understanding the sample application

In this tutorial, you will be working with a sample Servlet-based Spring Boot application that
uses [Spring Security OAuth2 Client library](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/client/index.html).

The application, once launched, has two pages:

- a **publicly-accessible home page (`/home`)**, available to everyone.
- a **user home page (`/authenticated/home`)**, for signed-in users only.

The security configuration for the above is located
at `com.vmware.tanzu.apps.sso.sampleworkload.config.WebSecurityConfig`.

For more information about how apps are configured with Spring Security OAuth2 Client library, see [Spring Boot and OAuth2 documentation](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/).

By default, there is no application properties file in our sample application and this is by design: even the simplest
application can be deployed with AppSSO, you can even go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) and download a
Spring Boot app with Spring Security OAuth2 Client library, and you are good to go! There is yet another reason for the
absence of any properties files: a demonstration
of [Spring Cloud Bindings](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bindings) in action, which removes the need for
any OAuth related properties. Spring Cloud Bindings will be introduced later in this tutorial.

#### <a id='sample-app-client-reg'></a> The sample application's `ClientRegistration`

A critical piece of integration with AppSSO is to create
a [ClientRegistration custom resource definition](../../crds/clientregistration.md). A `ClientRegistration` is a way
for AppSSO to learn about the sample application. In the sample application, you can find the definition file
named `client.yaml`, at the root of the source directory.

The `ClientRegistration` resource definition contains a few critical pieces in its specification:

- `authorizationGrantTypes` is set to a list of one: `authorization_code`. Authorization Code grant type is required for
  [OpenID Connect authentication](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) which we will be
  using in this tutorial.
- `redirectURIs` is set to two URIs: http based and https based. You might need only one URI based on your configuration. 
  AppSSO redirects the user back to these URIs upon successful authentication. The suffix is important for
  Spring Security and it adheres to [the default redirect URI template](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/core.html#oauth2login-sample-redirect-uri).
- `scopes` is set to a list of one scope, the `openid` scope. The `openid` scope
  is [required by OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) in
  order to issue identity tokens which designate a user as 'signed in'.

For more information about `ClientRegistration` custom resource, see [ClientRegistration CRD](../../crds/clientregistration.md).

The `client.yaml` file is using [ytt templating](https://carvel.dev/ytt/) conventions. If you have
the [Tanzu Cluster Essentials](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-cluster-essentials/) installed, you
should already have `ytt` available on your command line. Later in the tutorial, we will generate a final
output `ClientRegistration` declaration that will look similar to the below:

```yaml
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClientRegistration
metadata:
  name: appsso-starter-java
  namespace: workloads
spec:
  authServerSelector:
    matchLabels:
    # At least one unique label to target an `AuthServer`.
  clientAuthenticationMethod: client_secret_basic
  authorizationGrantTypes:
    - authorization_code
  redirectURIs:
    - https://<app-url>/login/oauth2/code/<workload-name>
    - http://<app-url>/login/oauth2/code/<workload-name>
  scopes:
    - name: openid
```

### Understanding `Workload`s

To deploy the sample application onto a TAP cluster, we must first craft it as a `Workload` resource (
a [Cartographer CRD](https://cartographer.sh/)). A `Workload` resource can be thought of as a manifest for a process you
want to execute on the cluster, and in this context, the type of workload is `web` - a web application. TAP clusters
provide the capability to apply `Workload` resources out of the box within the proper profiles, as described in
the [prerequisites](#prereqs) section.

## <a id="deploy-as-workload"></a> Deploying the sample application as a Workload

Follow these steps to deploy the sample application:

1. [Create a namespace for workloads](#create-namespace).
1. [Apply a client registration](#apply-client-registration).
1. [Create a resource claim for the workload](#create-resource-claim).
1. (Optional) Ensure `Workload` trusts `AuthServer`. 
For more information, see [Configure Workloads to trust a custom Certificate Authority (CA)](../service-operators/workload-trust-custom-ca.hbs.md).

    >**Important** You must ensure `Workload` trusts `AuthServer` if you use the default self-signed certificate `ClusterIssuer` while installing Tanzu Application Platform.

1. [Deploy the workload](#deploy-workload).

### <a id="create-namespace"></a>Create a namespace for workloads

Create a namespace called `workloads` and provision it as `Workload` ready:

```shell
kubectl create namespace workloads
kubectl label namespaces workloads apps.tanzu.vmware.com/tap-ns=""
```

For more information about provisioning namespaces for workloads, see [Set up developer namespaces](../../../set-up-namespaces.md)

### <a id="apply-client-registration"></a>Apply the `ClientRegistration`

Apply the `client.yaml` definition file from the 
[application-accelerator-samples/appsso-starter-java directory](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/appsso-starter-java):

```shell
ytt \
  --file client.yaml \
  --data-value namespace=workloads \
  --data-value workload_name=appsso-starter-java \
  --data-value domain=127.0.0.1.nip.io \
  --data-value authserver_label.my-sso=true \
  --data-value authserver_label.env=dev |
   kubectl apply -f-
```

Where:

- **namespace** - the namespace in which the workload will run.
- **workload_name** - the distinct name of the instance of the accelerator being deployed.
- **domain** - the domain name under which the workload will be deployed. The workload instance will use a subdomain to
  distinguish itself from other workloads. If working locally, `127.0.0.1.nip.io` is the easiest approach to get a
  working DNS route on a local cluster.
- **authserver_label.{matching-label}** - a uniquely identifying label(s) for your authorization server. In this example, we assume that
  the `AuthServer` resource has labels `my-sso: "true"` and `env: dev`. You can add as many identifying labels as needed.

This command generates a `ClientRegistration` definition and applies it to the cluster. To verify the status of the 
client registration, run:

```shell
kubectl get clientregistration appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
```

The output lists the `ClientRegistration` entry.

### <a id="create-resource-claim"></a>Create a ClientRegistration service resource claim for the workload

Using Tanzu Services plugin CLI, create a service resource claim for the workload:

> **Caution** Resource name must be the same name as the workload name.

```shell
tanzu service claim create appsso-starter-java \
    --namespace workloads \
    --resource-namespace workloads \
    --resource-name appsso-starter-java \
    --resource-kind ClientRegistration \
    --resource-api-version "sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1"
```

Once applied, you may check the status of the claim like so:

```shell
tanzu service claim list --namespace workloads
```

You should see `appsso-starter-java` claim with `Ready` status as `True`.

### <a id="deploy-workload"></a>Deploy the workload

The Tanzu CLI command to create a workload for the sample application should look like the following:

```shell
tanzu apps workload create appsso-starter-java \
    --namespace workloads \
    --type web \
    --label app.kubernetes.io/part-of=appsso-starter-java \
    --service-ref "appsso-starter-java=services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1:ResourceClaim:appsso-starter-java" \
    --git-repo "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples" \
    --sub-path "appsso-starter-java" \
    --git-branch main \
    --live-update \
    --yes
```

The above command creates a web `Workload` named 'appsso-starter-java' in the `workloads` namespace. The sample
applications' source code repository is defined by `git-repo`, `git-branch` and `sub-path`. The original
client yaml definition contains the reference to a service claim which enables the `Workload`'s pods to have the necessary
AppSSO-generated credentials available as a Service Binding. 
For more information, see [Register a workload](../register-an-app-with-app-sso.md#workloads).

It takes some minutes for the workload to become available through a browser-accessible URL.

To query the latest status of the workload, run:

```shell
tanzu apps workload get appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
```

> **Caution** You may see the status of the workload at first:
>
> **message**: waiting to read value [.status.latestImage] from resource [image.kpack.io/appsso-starter-java]
> in namespace [workloads]
>
> **reason**: `MissingValueAtPath`
>
> **status**: `Unknown`
>
> This is not an error, this is normal operation of a pending workload. Watch the status for changes.

Follow the `Workload` logs:

```shell
tanzu apps workload tail appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
```

After the status of the workload reaches the `Ready` state, you can navigate to the URL provided, which looks similar to:

```text
http://appsso-starter-java.workloads.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

Navigate to the URL in your favorite browser, and observe a large login button tailored for logging with AppSSO.

Once you have explored the accelerator and its operation, head on to the next section for uninstall
instructions.

## Cleaning up

You can delete the running application by running the following commands:

1. Delete the sample application `Workload`:

    ```shell
    tanzu apps workload delete appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
    ```

1. Delete the service resource claim for the `ClientRegistration`:

    ```shell
    tanzu service claim delete appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
    ```

1. Disconnect the client from AppSSO:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete clientregistration appsso-starter-java --namespace workloads
    ```
