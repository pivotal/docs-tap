# Application Single Sign-On for Service Operators

The following topics tell you how to configure a fully operational authorization
server for Application Single Sign-On (commonly called AppSSO).

`AuthServer` represents the request for an OIDC authorization server. It
results in the deployment of an authorization server backed by Redis. A Redis
with mTLS is either automatically deployed for `AuthServer` or credentials to
[external storage](storage.hbs.md) can be provided. You can configure the
labels with which clients can select an `AuthServer`, the namespaces it allows
clients from, its issuer URI, its token signature keys, identity providers, and
further details for its deployment.

`ClusterWorkloadRegistrationClass` exposes an `AuthServer` as a ready-to-claim
service offering. Application operators can discover this offering and claim
credentials. The mechanisms for this are provided by [Services
Toolkit](../../../services-toolkit/about.hbs.md). This is the recommended way for
offering and consuming AppSSO.

If you just want to get started in a non-production environment,
`ClusterUnsafeTestLogin` is a zero-config API that produces an unsafe,
ready-to-claim AppSSO service offering. It is a higher-level alternative to the
combination of `AuthServer` and `ClusterWorkloadRegistrationClass`.

For a full explanation of the available APIs, refer to [the API
reference](../../reference/api/index.hbs.md).

operational, ready-to-claim AppSSO service offering:
