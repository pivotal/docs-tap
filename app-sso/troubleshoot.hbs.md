# Troubleshoot Application Single Sign-on

## Why is my AuthServer not working?

Generally, `AuthServer.status` is designed to provide you with helpful feedback to debug a faulty `AuthServer`.

## Find all AuthServer-related Kubernetes resources

Identify all `AuthServer` components with Kubernetes common labels. For more information,
see [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/#labels).

Query all related `AuthServer` subresources by using `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` label. For example:

```yaml
kubectl get all,ingress,service -A -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=<authserver-name>
```

## Logs of all AuthServers

With [stern](https://github.com/stern/stern) you can tail the logs of all AppSSO managed `Pods` inside your cluster
with:

```shell
stern --all-namespaces --selector=app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com
```

## Change propagation

When applying changes to an `AuthServer`, keep in mind that changes to issuer URI, IDP, server and logging configuration
take a moment to be effective as the operator will roll out the authorization server `Deployment`.

## My Service is not selecting the authorization server's Deployment

If you are deploying your `Service` with [kapp](https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/) make sure to set the
annotation `kapp.k14s.io/disable-default-label-scoping-rules: ""` to avoid that kapp amends `Service.spec.selector`.

## Redirect URIs are redirecting to http instead of https with a non-internal identity provider

Follow [this workaround](known-issues/index.md#cidr-ranges), adding IP ranges for the `AuthServer` to trust.

## Misconfigured `clientSecret`

### Problem:

When attempting to sign in, you see `This commonly happens due to an incorrect [client_secret].` It might be because the
client secret of an identity provider is misconfigured.

### Solution:

Validate the `spec.OpenId.clientSecretRef`.

## Misconfigured redirect URI

### Problem:

You see `Error: [invalid_request] OAuth 2.0 Parameter: redirect_uri` when signing in.

### Solution:

The `redirectURIs` of a `ClientRegistration` must refer to the URI of the registered `Workload`.
It does not refer to the URI of the AuthServer. Read more [here](app-operators/workloads-and-appsso.hbs.md#redirect-uris).

## Unsupported `id_token_signed_response_alg` with openid `identityProviders`

### Problem:

When trying to log in with an OpenID Connect `identityProvider`, you are unable to sign in
and you see the following error in the logs: 

```console
[invalid_id_token] An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: Signed JWT rejected: Another algorithm expected, or no matching key(s) found.
```

### Solution:

Verify the `identityProvider`'s discovery endpoint at `ISSUER-URI/.well-known/openid-configuration` where `ISSUER-URI` is the value set at `spec.identityProviders.openid.issuerURI`.

The value of `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` must include `RS256`. If it is not in the list, your identity configuration might not support AppSSO.

If `RS256` is present, expect to see a `jwks_uri` key in the discovery endpoint. If you visit the URL stored in this key, it must return at least one RSA key. Otherwise, your identity provider might be misconfigured.

Refer to your identity provider's documentation to enable `RS256` token signing.

## Misconfigured identity provider clientSecret

### Problem:

- When attempting to sign in, you see `client.samples.localhost.identity.team redirected you too many times.` It might
  be because the client secret of an identity provider is misconfigured.
- If you have access to the authserver logs, verify if there is an entry with the text
  `"error":"[invalid_client] Client authentication failed: client_secret"`.

### Solution:

- Validate the secret referenced by the `clientSecretRef` for this particular identity provider in
  your `authserver.spec`.

## Missing scopes

### Problem:

When attempting to fetch data after signing in to your application by using AppSSO, you
see `[invalid_scope] OAuth 2.0 Parameter: scope`.

### Solution:

Add the required scopes into your `ClientRegistration` yaml under `spec.scopes`.

Changes to the secret do not propagate to the `ClientRegistration`. If you recreated the `Secret` that 
contains the `clientSecret`, you must re-deploy the `ClientRegistration`.

## <a id="sub-claim"></a>Misconfigured `sub` claim

### Problem:

The `sub` claims in `id_token`s and `access_token`s follow the `<providerId>_<userId>` pattern.
The previous `<providerId>/<userId>` pattern might cause bugs in URLs without proper URL-encoding in client
applications.

### Solution:

If your client application stores `sub` claims,
you must update the `sub` claims to match the new pattern `<providerId>_<userId>`.
