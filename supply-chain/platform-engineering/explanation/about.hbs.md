# Explanations for Platform Engineers

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }}

This section ties together the core architectural concepts of Tanzu Supply Chain.
It focuses on authoring a platform for application development.

At its core, the Tanzu Supply Chain enables platform engineers to author a seamless experience for 
development work; an experience that does not require an understanding of kubernetes.

## System overview

Each [SupplyChain] resource combines multiple [Components] in `stages`. 
[SupplyChains] define a process for converting configuration [Workloads] into final artifacts.
They are very similar to pipelines in other CI/CD systems, with some key differences:

* The [SupplyChain] defines a [Workload] CRD, which becomes the interface that end users (typically developers) consume to have work done.
* End users are typically unaware of the inner-workings of the [SupplyChain] and [Components].
* [Components] are designed to encapsulate the work of generating a final or intermediate artifact, _and quite importantly_, the work of discovering new work to be done.

The flow of operations is as follows:

1. Apply a valid [SupplyChain], [Components] and accompanying Tekton Tasks and Pipelines.
2. Tanzu Supply Chain generates a [Workload] custom resource definition as defined by the [SupplyChain].
3. A developer discovers the Workload Kinds available to them using the Tanzu CLI.
4. The developer generates a workload and fills in the required configuration.
5. After applying the Workload, Tanzu Supply Chain starts the first [WorkloadRun], capturing progress and artifacts as it progresses.
6. Tanzu Supply Chain monitors [Components] that have [Resumptions] to discover if new runs need to be generated.
   1. New configuration in the [Workload] triggers new runs.
   2. New source code, base images, or other triggers from [Resumptions] trigger new runs.
7. The developer observes the progress of runs using the Tanzu CLI

## GitOps management of SupplyChains

SupplyChains, especially the authoring resources ([SupplyChain], [Component] and Tekton Pipeline/Task), are designed to
be delivered to clusters via a Git repository and GitOps source promotion style.

See [GitOps Managed SupplyChains](./gitops-managed.hbs.md) for details.

## Discover the primitives of a Tanzu Supply Chain

- [SupplyChains] define the Workload Kind, and the components to use.
- [Workloads] provide an end user (developer) API
- [WorkloadRuns] provide a record of each progression through a supply chain.
- [Components] provide an abstraction for a piece of work, and reasons to trigger new runs.
- [Resumptions] provide a process for defining the triggering of new runs
