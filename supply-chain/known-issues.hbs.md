# Tanzu Supply Chains Known Issues

This topic lists known issues for Tanzu Supply Chains.

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }}

## Workload Visibility

- Tekton failures in Tasks are not propagated properly in the status of the `WorkloadRuns` and
thereby not visible in the `tanzu workload run get` outputs.
- Errors in the `Component` pipelines and exposed as a message is not properly propagated in the
status of the `WorkloadRun` and thereby not visible in the `tanzu workload run get` outputs.

## Component Authoring

- Components cannot have more than one resumption defined. When there are multiple resumptions,
the `WorkloadRuns` are not being correctly created upon changes triggered by these resumptions.
The current workaround is to assess all triggers in a single resumption.

## Security

- The Tekton `Pipelines` and `Tasks` are currently running in the Developer namespace where the
`Workload` is. In future release, `SupplyChain` namespaces will run these resources for the
`Component` unless its specifically chosen by the component author to run in the Developer
namespace. There are use cases for components such as `source-git-provider` where a Developer
can provide a secret to pull the source for their repository without the Platform Engineer being the bottleneck.

## Kubernetes Distribution Support

- The Beta release of Tanzu Supply Chains does not include support for Openshift. However, this
support is planned to be integrated into upcoming versions. Presently, attempting to individually
install components for Tanzu Supply Chains and Managed Resource Controller, as well as installing
the Authoring profile that comes with those components out of the box, results in failure due
to the absence of this support.
