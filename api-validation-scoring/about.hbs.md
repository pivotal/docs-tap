# Overview of API Validation and Scoring

> **Caution** The APIx package used for API scoring and validation is deprecated.
> It will be removed in the next Tanzu Application Platform release.

API Validation and Scoring focuses on scanning and validating an OpenAPI specification. 
The API specification is generated from the [API Auto Registration](../api-auto-registration/about.hbs.md). 
After an API is registered, the API specification goes through static scan analysis and is validated. 
Based on the validation, a scoring is provided to indicate the quality and health 
of the API specification as it relates to Documentation, OpenAPI best practices, and Security. 
The Validation Analysis card on the API overview page displays the summary of the scores. 
To learn more details about the scores, you can go to the detailed view by clicking the **MORE DETAILS** link. 

API Validation and Scoring helps you to ensure your APIs are secure and robust, 
by providing feedback and recommendations early on in the software development life cycle. 
Based on the feedback and recommendations, you can edit your API specifications, 
improve the scores and the posture of your APIs and better understand how well the APIs are implemented.
