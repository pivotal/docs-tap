**Deploy applications directly from VS Code**

The Tanzu Dev Tools extension enables rapid iteration of your applications on
Tanzu Application Platform by deploying them as workloads directly from within VS Code.

**See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**

With Live Update (facilitated by Tilt), the Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to deploy
your workload once, save changes to the code and see those changes reflected within seconds in the
workload running on the cluster.

**Debug workloads directly on the cluster**

The Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to debug your application in a production-like
environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster enabled by Tanzu Application Platform.
An environment’s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies and other variables updated.

**See workloads running on the cluster**

From the Workloads panel you can see any workload found within the cluster and namespace specified in
the current kubectl context.
