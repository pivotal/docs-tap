- **Deploy applications directly from VS Code**
  Rapidly iterate on your applications on Tanzu Application Platform by deploying them as workloads
  directly from within VS Code.

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**
  With Live Update (facilitated by Tilt), you can deploy your workload once, save changes to the code
  and then see those changes reflected within seconds in the workload running on the cluster.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster**
  Debug your application in a production-like environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster
  that has Tanzu Application Platform.
  An environmentâ€™s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies and other variables updated.

- **See workloads running on the cluster**
  From the Tanzu Workloads panel you can see any workload found within the cluster and namespace
  specified in the current kubectl context.
