# Enable Authorization on Remote GKE Clusters in Tanzu Application Platform GUI using Google Auth

This section describes how to leverage Google Auth to add access-controlled visibility for a remote GKE cluster.

Once the Authorization is enabled, you can view your runtime resources on a remote cluster in Tanzu Application Platform GUI. For more detail, please refer to [View Runtime Resources on Remote Clusters in Tanzu Application Platform GUI](./view-resouces-rbac.md).


## <a id="googles-oidc-provider"></a> Leveraging Google Auth

When levearging Google's OIDC provider, the process of enabling Authorization requires fewer steps:

1. Add a redirect config on the OIDC side
2. Configure the Tanzu Application Platform GUI to view the remote GKE cluster
3. Upgrade the Tanzu Application GUI package

### <a id="create-oauth-credentials"></a> Create OAuth credentials in Google

1. Log in to the [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. From the dropdown menu on the top bar, select the project to which your GKE cluster belongs.
3. Navigate to
   [APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent), if a consent screen has not already been configured for this
   project.
   - Add the top domain of your TAP GUI server as an Authorized domain
   - For scopes, select `openid`, `auth/userinfo.email` and
     `auth/userinfo.profile`


4. Navigate to
   [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
5. Click **Create Credentials** and choose `OAuth client ID`

6. Select **Application Type** as `Web Application`

7. Populate the following dialog boxes with these settings:
   - Name: TAP GUI (or your custom app name)
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN`
   - Authorized Redirect URIs:
     `http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN/api/auth/google/handler/frame`

Where:

   - `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the ingress domain you specified during the installation of Tanzu Application Platform GUI

1. Click `Create` and store your credentials.

### <a id="configure-tap-gui"></a> Configure the Tanzu Application Platform GUI

The next step is to configure visibility of the remote GKE cluster in Tanzu Application Platform GUI. 

1. Make sure you added an `auth` section to the `app_config` stanza that Tanzu Application Platform GUI uses. In the example for Auth0, copy this YAML content into `tap-values.yml`:


```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    google:
      development:
        clientId: "CLIENT-ID"
        clientSecret: "CLIENT-SECRET"
```
Where:

   - `CLIENT-ID` is the Client ID you obtained while setting up the OIDC provider
   - `CLIENT-SECRET` is the Client Secret you obtained while setting up the OIDC provider


1. You must also add a `kubernetes` section to the `app_config` stanza that Tanzu Application Platform GUI uses. This section must have an entry for each cluster that has resources to view.

To do so, copy this YAML content into `tap-values.yml`:

```yaml
kubernetes:
  clusterLocatorMethods:
    - type: 'config'
      clusters:
        - name: "CLUSTER-NAME-UNCONSTRAINED"
          url: "CLUSTER-URL"
          authProvider: google
          caData: "CA-DATA"
```
Where:

   - `CLUSTER-NAME-UNCONSTRAINED` is the cluster name of your choice for your GKE cluster
   - `CLUSTER_URL` is the URL for the remote cluster you are connecting to Tanzu Application Platform GUI. To obtain your cluster's URL, execute the following command:

```console
CLUSTER_URL=$(kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}')

echo CLUSTER-URL: $CLUSTER_URL
```

- `CA-DATA` is the CA certificate data.

Execute the following command to obtain the value:

```console
CA_DATA=$(kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}' --raw)

echo CA-DATA: $CA_DATA
```

If there are any other clusters that you would like to make visible through Tanzu Application Platform GUI, add their entries to `clusters` as well.

### <a id="upgrade-tap-gui"></a> Upgrade the Tanzu Application Platform GUI package

Once the new configuration file is ready, update the `tap-gui` package by running this command:

```console
tanzu package installed update tap-gui --values-file tap-gui-values.yaml
```    

Or, if you were updating the `tap-values.yml` file, run the following command: 

```console
tanzu package installed update tap --values-file tap-values.yml
```

Wait a moment for the `tap-gui` package to update and then verify that `STATUS` is
`Reconcile succeeded` by running:

```console
tanzu package installed get tap-gui -n tap-install
```
