# Application Accelerator in Tanzu Application Platform GUI

## What is Application Accelerator?

Application Accelerator for VMware Tanzu helps you bootstrap developing and deploying your applications in a discoverable and repeatable way.

Enterprise Architects author and publish accelerator projects that provide developers and operators with ready-made, enterprise-conformant code and configurations. You can then use Application Accelerator to create new projects based on those accelerator projects.

The Application Accelerator user interface (UI) enables you to discover available accelerators, configure them, and generate new projects to download.

## Entry point to Application Accelerator

The Application Accelerator UI plug-in is part of the Tanzu Application Platform GUI. To access Application Accelerator,
click `Create` in the left-hand navigation bar of the Tanzu Application Platform. This opens teh `Accelerators page`.

Here you can view accelerators already registered with the system.
Developers can add new accelerators by registering them with Kubernetes.

Every accelerator provides a title and short description. You can browse an accelerator definition by clicking `View Repository`, which opens the accelerator's Git repository in a new browser tab.

This main page allows you to search and filter based on text and tags associated with the accelerators. Once you find the accelerator representing the project you want to create, click `Choose`. This opens the `Generate Accelerators` page.

## Configuring project generation

On the `Generate Accelerators` page, supply any configuration options needed to generate the project.
The Application Architect will have defined these in the `accelerator.yaml` in the accelerator definition. Setting some options may
cause others to appear that also need to be specified. If there are any errors on this page, for example, missing option values for required options, you'll get an error.

Required fields are marked with a `*`.

## Exploring a project during configuration

You can now browse the project before it is actually generated by clicking `Explore` on the `Generate Accelerators` page. This opens the `Explore Project` page as shown in the following screenshot.

When you've finished configuring your project, click `Next Step` to see the project summary page. You are now ready to create the project.

## Project summary

This page shows the values you have specified for the configurable options.

You can return to customize options (click `Back`) if needed. Otherwise, you're ready to generate your accelerator.

## Creating the project

To generate your project, click `Create`. The system starts generating your project and the Task Activity page shows the progress, with detailed logs on the right side.

After the project is generated, you can:

- Click `Explore Zip File`. This opens the Explore Project page (see step xxx) if you wish to verify configuration.
- Click `Download Zip File` to download the project in a ZIP file.

## Develop your code

After you've downloaded the ZIP file, expand it, and open the project in your favorite integrated development environment (IDE).
