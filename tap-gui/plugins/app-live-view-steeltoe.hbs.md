## <a id="environment-page"></a> Environment page

To access the **Environment** page, select the **Environment** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down menu.

The Environment page contains details of the applications' environment.
It contains properties including, but not limited to, system properties, environment variables, and
configuration properties (such as appsettings.json) in a Steeltoe application.

The page includes the following capabilities for `viewing` configured environment properties:

- The UI has a search feature that enables the user to search for a property or values.
- Each property has a search icon at the right corner which helps the user quickly see all the
  occurrences of a specific property key without manually typing in the search box.
  Clicking the search button locates the property name.
- The **Refresh Scope** button on the top right corner of the page probes the application to refresh
  all the environment properties.

The page also includes the following capabilities for `editing` configured environment properties:

- The UI allows the user to edit environment properties and see the live changes in the application.
  These edits are temporary and go away if the underlying pod is restarted.
- For each of the configured environment properties, the user can edit its value by clicking on the
  **Override** button in the same row.
  After the value is saved, the user can view the message that the property was overridden from the
  initial value. Also, the updated property is visible in the **Applied Overrides** section at the
  top of the page.
  The **Reset** button in the same row resets the environment property to the initial state.
- The user can also edit or remove the overridden environment variables in the **Applied Overrides**
  section.
- The **Applied Overrides** section also enables the user to add new environment properties to the
  application.

> **Note** The `management.endpoint.env.post.enabled=true` must be set in the application config
> properties of the application, and a corresponding editable environment must be present in the
> application.
