## <a id="environment-page"></a> Environment page

To navigate to the **Environment** page, the user can select the **Environment** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down menu.
The Environment page contains details of the applications' environment.
It contains properties including, but not limited to, system properties, environment variables, and
configuration properties (such as application.properties) in a Spring Boot application.

The page includes the following capabilities for `viewing` configured environment properties:

- The UI has a search feature that enables the user to search for a property or values.
- Each property has a search icon at the right corner which helps the user quickly see all the
  occurrences of a specific property key without manually typing in the search box.
  Clicking the search button locates the property name.
- The **Refresh Scope** button on the top right corner of the page probes the application to refresh
  all the environment properties.

The page also includes the following capabilities for `editing` configured environment properties:

- The UI allows the user to edit environment properties and see the live changes in the application.
  These edits are temporary and go away if the underlying pod is restarted.
- For each of the configured environment properties, the user can edit its value by clicking on
  the **Override** button in the same row.
  After the value is saved, the user can view the message that the property was overridden from the
  initial value. The updated property is visible in the **Applied Overrides** section at the
  top of the page.
  The **Reset** button in the same row resets the environment property to the initial state.
- The user can also edit or remove the overridden environment variables in the **Applied Overrides**
  section.
- The **Applied Overrides** section also enables the user to add new environment properties to the
  application.

> **Note** `management.endpoint.env.post.enabled=true` must be set in the application config
> properties of the application and a corresponding, editable environment must be present in the
> application.

The user can search for a package and edit its respective log level.
The user can configure the log levels at a specific class and package.
They can deactivate all the log levels by modifying the log level of root logger to OFF.

The toggle **Changes Only** displays the changed log levels.
The search feature enables the user to search by logger name.
The **Reset** resets the log levels to the original state.
The **Reset All** on top right corner of the page resets all the loggers to default state.

> **Note** The UI allows the user to change the log levels and see the live changes on the application.
> These changes are temporary and will go away if the underlying pod gets restarted.

## <a id="memory-page"></a> Memory page

To navigate to the **Memory** page, the user can select the **Memory** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down menu.

- The memory page highlights the memory use inside of the JVM. It displays a graphical representation
  of the different memory regions within heap and non-heap memory.
  This visualizes data from inside of the JVM (in case of Spring Boot apps running on a JVM) and
  therefore provides memory insights into the application in contrast to "outside" information about
  the Kubernetes pod level.
- The real-time graphs displays a stacked overview of the different spaces in memory with the total
  memory used and total memory size. The page contains graphs to display the GC pauses and GC events.
- The **Heap Dump** at the top-right corner enables the user to download heap dump data.

![Memory Page in the UI showing four graphs. The top-left graph is selected.](images/memory.png)

>**Note** This graphical visualization happens in real time and shows real-time data only.
As mentioned at the top, the Application Live View features do not store any information.
That means the graphs visualize the data over time only for as long as you stay on that page.

## <a id="request-mappings-page"></a> Request Mappings page

To navigate to the Request Mappings page, the user should select the **Request Mappings** option from
the **Information Category** drop-down menu.

This page provides information about the application’s request mappings.
For each of the mapping, it displays the request handler method.
The user can view more details of the request mapping such as header metadata of the application.

When a user clicks on the request mapping, a side panel appears.
This panel contains information about the mapping-media types `Produces` and `Consumes`.
The panel also displays the `Handler` class for the request.
The search feature enables the user to search on the request mapping or the method.
The toggle **/actuator/\*\* Request Mappings** displays the actuator related mappings of the
application.

> **Note** When application actuator endpoint is exposed on `management.server.port`, the application
> does not return any actuator request mappings data in the context.
> The application displays a message when the actuator toggle is enabled.

To navigate to the HTTP Requests page, the user should select the **HTTP Requests** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down menu.
The HTTP Requests page provides information about HTTP request-response exchanges to the application.

The graph visualizes the requests per second indicating the response status of all the requests.
The user can filter on the response statuses which include info, success, redirects, client-errors,
server-errors.
The trace data is captured in detail in a tabular format with metrics such as timestamp, method, path,
status, content-type, length, time.

The search feature on the table filters the traces based on the search field value.
The user can view more details of the request such as method, headers, response of the application
by clicking on the timestamp.
The refresh icon above the graph loads the latest traces of the application.
The toggle **/actuator/\*\*** on the top right corner of the page displays the actuator related
traces of the application.
