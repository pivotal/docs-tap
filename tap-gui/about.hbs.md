# Overview of Tanzu Developer Portal

Tanzu Developer Portal is a tool for your developers to view your applications and services running
for your organization. This portal provides a central location in which you can view dependencies,
relationships, technical documentation, and the service status.

Tanzu Developer Portal is built from the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://www.cncf.io/) project [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

Tanzu Developer Portal consists of the following components:

- **Your organization catalog:**

  The catalog serves as the primary visual representation of your running services (components) and
  applications (systems).

- **Tanzu Developer Portal plug-ins:**

  These plug-ins expose capabilities regarding specific Tanzu Application Platform tools.
  Initially the included plug-ins are:

  - Runtime Resources Visibility
  - Application Live View
  - Application Accelerator
  - API Documentation
  - Supply Chain Choreographer
  - Security Analysis
  - DORA Metrics

- **TechDocs:**

  This plug-in enables you to store your technical documentation in Markdown format in a source-code
  repository and display it alongside the relevant catalog entries.

- **Search:**

  components, APIs, accelerators, and TechDocs.

- **A Git repository:**

  Tanzu Developer Portal stores the following in a Git repository:
