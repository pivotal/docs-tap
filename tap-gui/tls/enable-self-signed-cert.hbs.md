# Configure a TLS certificate by using a self-signed certificate

This topic tells you how to use cert-manager to create a self-signed certificate issuer and then
generate a certificate for Tanzu Developer Portal (formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI) to
use based on that issuer.

Some browsers and corporate policies do not allow you to visit webpages that have self-signed
certificates. You might need to navigate through a series of error messages to visit the page.

## <a id="prereq"></a> Prerequisite

Install a Tanzu Application Platform profile that includes cert-manager.
Verify you did this by running the following command to detect the cert-manager namespace:

```console
kubectl get ns
```

## <a id="procedure"></a> Procedure

To configure a self-signed TLS certificate for Tanzu Developer Portal:

1. Create a `certificate.yaml` file that defines an issuer and a certificate. For example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: ca-issuer
     namespace: tap-gui
   spec:
     selfSigned: {}
   ---
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: tap-gui-cert
     namespace: tap-gui
   spec:
     secretName: tap-gui-cert
     dnsNames:
     - tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
     issuerRef:
       name: ca-issuer
   ```

   Where `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is your domain value that matches the values you used when you installed
   the profile.

2. Add the issuer and certificate to your cluster by running:

   ```console
   kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
   ```

3. Configure Tanzu Developer Portal to use the newly created certificate.
   Update the `tap-values.yaml` file used during installation to include the following under the
   `tap-gui` section:

   - A top-level `tls` key with subkeys for `namespace` and `secretName`
   - A namespace referring to the namespace containing the `Certificate` object mentioned earlier
   - A secret name referring to the `secretName` value defined in your `Certificate` resource earlier

   Example:

   ```yaml
   tap_gui:
     tls:
       namespace: tap-gui
       secretName: tap-gui-cert
    # Additional configuration below this line as needed
   ```

4. Update the Tanzu Application Platform package with the new values in `tap-values.yaml`:

   ```console
   tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v TAP-VERSION  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
   ```

   Where `TAP-VERSION` is the version that matches the values you used when you installed the profile.
