# Tanzu Build Service

VMware Tanzu Build Service automates container creation, management, and governance at enterprise scale.
Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
project to turn application source code into container images.
It executes reproducible builds aligned with modern container standards and keeps images up to date.
