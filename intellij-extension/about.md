- **Deploy applications directly from IntelliJ**

    With the Tanzu Dev Tools extension, you can rapidly iterate on your applications on Tanzu Application Platform and deploy them as workloads directly from within IntelliJ.

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**

    Using Live Update facilitated by Tilt, the Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to deploy your workload once, then save changes to the code and see those changes reflected within seconds in the workload running on the cluster.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster**

    The Tanzu Developer Tools extension enables you to debug your application in a production-like environment* by debugging on your Tanzu Application Platform-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

    *An environment’s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies updated, among other variables.
