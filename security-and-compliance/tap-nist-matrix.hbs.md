# Assess Tanzu Application Platform against the NIST 800-53 Moderate Assessment

This topic provides you with an assessment of Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) against the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Moderate baseline  controls. This translates to FISMA Moderate and CNSSI 1253 Mod/Mod/Mod for use in US Federal systems accreditation.

The Moderate baseline applies to only technical controls.
Organizational policy controls, physical security, media policies, and similar
are excluded as they are not applicable to Tanzu Application Platform. These excluded
controls are still relevant to the system at large and must be inherited from existing accreditations
or otherwise addressed.

The initial iteration of this assessment delineates responsible parties.
Incremental updates will add more details about implementation and updates to 800-53 Revision 5.
