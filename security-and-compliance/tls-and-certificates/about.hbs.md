# TLS and certificates

Ingress communication uses TLS by default. Platform operators can control
certificates and how they are used by components. For more information, see
[Ingress certificates](./ingress/about.hbs.md).

For egress communication, you can establish trust for custom CA certificates.
For more information, see [Custom CA certificates](./custom-ca-certificates.hbs.md).
