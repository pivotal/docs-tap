# Troubleshoot using Tanzu Application Platform

This topic tells you how to troubleshoot using Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

## <a id='use-events'></a> Use events to find possible causes

Events can highlight issues with components in a supply chain. For example, high occurrences of `StampedObjectApplied`
or `ResourceOutputChanged` can indicate problems with trashing on a component.

To view the recent events for a workload, run:

```console
kubectl describe workload.carto.run <workload-name> -n <workload-ns>
```

---

## <a id='missing-build-logs'></a> Missing build logs after creating a workload

You create a workload, but no logs appear when you run:

  ```console
  tanzu apps workload tail workload-name --since 10m --timestamp
  ```

### Explanation

Common causes include:

- Misconfigured repository
- Misconfigured service account
- Misconfigured registry credentials

### Solution

To resolve this issue, run:

```console
kubectl get clusterbuilder.kpack.io -o yaml
```

```console
kubectl get image.kpack.io <workload-name> -o yaml
```

```console
kubectl get build.kpack.io -o yaml
```
---

## <a id='builder-not-ready'></a> Workload creation stops responding with "Builder default is not ready" message

You can see the "Builder default is not ready" message in two places:

1. The "Messages" section of the `tanzu apps workload get my-app` command.
2. The Supply Chain section of Tanzu Developer Portal (formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI).

This message indicates there is something wrong with the Builder (the component that builds the
container image for your workload).

### Explanation

This message is typically encountered when the core component of the Builder (`kpack`) transitions
into a bad state.

Although this isn't the only scenario where this can happen, `kpack` can transition into a bad state
when Tanzu Application Platform is deployed to a local `minikube` or `kind` cluster, and especially
when that `minikube` or `kind` cluster is restarted.

### Solution

1. Restart `kpack` by deleting the `kpack-controller` and `kpack-webhook` pods in the `kpack` namespace.
   Deleting these resources triggers their recreation:
   - `kubectl delete pods --all --namespace kpack`
2. Verify status of the replacement pods:
   - `kubectl get pods --namespace kpack`
3. Verify the workload status after the new kpack pods `STATUS` are `Running`:
   - `tanzu apps workload get YOUR-WORKLOAD-NAME`

---

## <a id='error-update'></a> "Workload already exists" error after updating the workload

When you update the workload, you receive the following error:

```console
Error: workload "default/APP-NAME" already exists
Error: exit status 1
```

Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app.

For example, when you run:

```console
tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
--git-repo https://github.com/dbuchko/tanzu-java-web-app \
--git-branch main \
--type web \
--label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests=true \
--yes
```

You receive the following error

```console
Error: workload "default/tanzu-java-web-app" already exists
Error: exit status 1
```

### Explanation

The app is running before performing a Live Update using the same app name.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, either delete the app or use a different name for the app.

---

## <a id='workload-fails-docker-auth'></a>Workload creation fails due to authentication failure in Docker Registry

You might encounter an error message similar to the following when creating or updating a workload by using IDE or `apps` CLI plug-in:

```console
Error: Writing 'index.docker.io/shaileshp2922/build-service/tanzu-java-web-app:latest': Error while preparing a transport to talk with the registry: Unable to create round tripper: GET https://auth.ipv6.docker.com/token?scope=repository%3Ashaileshp2922%2Fbuild-service%2Ftanzu-java-web-app%3Apush%2Cpull&service=registry.docker.io: unexpected status code 401 Unauthorized: {"details":"incorrect username or password"}
```

### Explanation

This type of error frequently occurs when the URL set for `source image` (IDE) or `--source-image` flag (`apps` CLI plug-in) is not Docker registry compliant.

### Solution

1. Verify that you can authenticate directly against the Docker registry and resolve any failures by running:

    ```console
    docker login -u USER-NAME
    ```

2. Verify your `--source-image` URL is compliant with Docker.

    The URL in this example `index.docker.io/shaileshp2922/build-service/tanzu-java-web-app` includes nesting.
    Docker registry, unlike many other registry solutions, does not support nesting.

3. To resolve this issue, you must provide an unnested URL. For example, `index.docker.io/shaileshp2922/tanzu-java-web-app`

---

## <a id='telem-fails-fetch-secret'></a> Telemetry component logs show errors fetching the "reg-creds" secret

When you view the logs of the `tap-telemetry` controller by running `kubectl logs -n
tap-telemetry <tap-telemetry-controller-<hash> -f`, you see the following error:

  ```console
  "Error retrieving secret reg-creds on namespace tap-telemetry","error":"secrets \"reg-creds\" is forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:tap-telemetry:controller\" cannot get resource \"secrets\" in API group \"\" in the namespace \"tap-telemetry\""
  ```

### Explanation

The `tap-telemetry` namespace misses a role that allows the controller to list secrets in the
`tap-telemetry` namespace. For more information about roles, see
[Role and ClusterRole Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole).

### Solution

To resolve this issue, run:

```console
kubectl patch roles -n tap-telemetry tap-telemetry-controller --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/rules/-", "value": {"apiGroups": [""],"resources": ["secrets"],"verbs": ["get", "list", "watch"]} }]'
```

---

## <a id='debug-convention'></a> Debug convention might not apply

If you upgrade from Tanzu Application Platform v0.4, the debug convention can not apply to the app
run image.

### Explanation

The Tanzu Application Platform v0.4 lacks SBOM data.

### Solution

Delete existing app images that were built using Tanzu Application Platform v0.4.

---

## <a id='build-scripts-lack-ex-bit'></a> Execute bit not set for App Accelerator build scripts

You cannot execute a build script provided as part of an accelerator.

### Explanation

Build scripts provided as part of an accelerator do not have the execute bit set when a new
project is generated from the accelerator.

### Solution

Explicitly set the execute bit by running the `chmod` command:

```console
chmod +x BUILD-SCRIPT-NAME
```

Where `BUILD-SCRIPT-NAME` is the name of the build script.

For example, for a project generated from the "Spring PetClinic" accelerator, run:

```console
chmod +x ./mvnw
```

---

## <a id='no-live-information'></a> "No live information for pod with ID" error

After deploying Tanzu Application Platform workloads, Tanzu Developer Portal shows a "No
live information for pod with ID" error.

### Explanation

The connector must discover the application instances and render the details in Tanzu Application
Platform GUI.

### Solution

Recreate the Application Live View Connector pod by running:

```console
kubectl -n app-live-view delete pods -l=name=application-live-view-connector
```

This allows the connector to discover the application instances and render the details in Tanzu
Application Platform GUI.

---

## <a id='image-pol-wh-serv-not-fnd'></a> "image-policy-webhook-service not found" error

When installing a Tanzu Application Platform profile, you receive the following error:

```console
Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": failed to call webhook: Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": service "image-policy-webhook-service" not found
```

### Explanation

The "image-policy-webhook-service" service cannot be found.

### Solution

Redeploy the `trainingPortal` resource.

---

## <a id='increase-clus-resources'></a> "Increase your cluster resources" error

You receive an "Increase your cluster's resources" error.

### Explanation

Node pressure can be caused by an insufficient number of nodes or a lack of resources on nodes
necessary to deploy the workloads.

### Solution

Follow instructions from your cloud provider to scale out or scale up your cluster.

---

## <a id='pod-admission-prevented'></a> MutatingWebhookConfiguration prevents pod admission

Admission of all pods is prevented when the `image-policy-controller-manager` deployment pods do not
start before the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` is applied to the cluster.

### Explanation

Pods are prevented from starting if nodes in a cluster are scaled to zero and the webhook is
forced to restart at the same time as other system components. A deadlock can occur when some
components expect the webhook to verify their image signatures and the webhook is not currently running.

A known rare condition during Tanzu Application Platform profiles installation can cause this. If so,
you can see a message similar to one of the following in component statuses:

```console
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age                   From                   Message

  Warning  FailedCreate      4m28s                 replicaset-controller  Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": no endpoints available for service "image-policy-webhook-service"
```

```console
Events:

  Warning FailedCreate 10m replicaset-controller Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": service "image-policy-webhook-service" not found
```

## Solution

Delete the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource to resolve the deadlock and enable the system to
restart. After the system is stable, restore the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource to re-enable
image signing enforcement.

>**Important** These steps temporarily deactivate signature verification in your cluster.

1. Back up `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` to a file by running:

    ```console
    kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration -o yaml > image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
    ```

1. Delete `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` by running:

    ```console
    kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration
    ```

1. Wait until all components are up and running in your cluster, including the
`image-policy-controller-manager pods` (namespace `image-policy-system`).

1. Re-apply `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` by running:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
    ```

## <a id='priority-class-preempts'></a> Priority class of webhook's pods preempts less privileged pods

When viewing the output of `kubectl get events`, you see events similar to:

```console
$ kubectl get events
LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON             OBJECT               MESSAGE
28s         Normal    Preempted          pod/testpod          Preempted by image-policy-system/image-policy-controller-manager-59dc669d99-frwcp on node test-node
```

### Explanation

The Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Sign component uses a privileged `PriorityClass` to start
its pods to prevent node pressure from preempting its pods. This can cause less privileged
components to have their pods preempted or evicted instead.

### Solution

- **Solution 1: Reduce the number of pods deployed by the Sign component:**
    If your deployment of the Sign component runs more pods than necessary, scale the deployment
    down as follows:

    1. Create a values file named `scst-sign-values.yaml` with the following contents:

        ```console
        ---
        replicas: N
        ```

        Where `N` is an integer indicating the lowest number of pods you necessary for your current
        cluster configuration.

    2. Apply the new configuration by running:

        ```console
        tanzu package installed update image-policy-webhook \
          --package-name image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
          --version 1.0.0-beta.3 \
          --namespace tap-install \
          --values-file scst-sign-values.yaml
        ```

    3. Wait a few minutes for your configuration to take effect in the cluster.

- **Solution 2: Increase your cluster's resources:**
    Node pressure can be caused by an insufficient number of nodes or a lack of resources on nodes
    necessary to deploy the workloads. Follow instructions from your cloud provider
    to scale out or scale up your cluster.

## <a id='pw-authentication-fails'></a> CrashLoopBackOff from password authentication fails

SCST - Store does not start. You see the following error in the
`metadata-store-app` Pod logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs pod/metadata-store-app-* -n metadata-store -c metadata-store-app
...
[error] failed to initialize database, got error failed to connect to `host=metadata-store-db user=metadata-store-user database=metadata-store`: server error (FATAL: password authentication failed for user "metadata-store-user" (SQLSTATE 28P01))
```

### Explanation

The database password has changed between deployments. This is not supported.

### Solution

Redeploy the app either with the original database password or follow the latter steps to erase the
data on the volume:

1. Deploy `metadata-store app` with kapp.

2. Verify that the `metadata-store-db-*` pod fails.

3. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl exec -it metadata-store-db-KUBERNETES-ID -n metadata-store /bin/bash
    ```

    Where `KUBERNETES-ID` is the ID generated by Kubernetes and appended to the pod name.

4. To delete all database data, run:

    ```console
    rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*
    ```

    This is the path found in `postgres-db-deployment.yaml`.

5. Delete the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

6. Deploy the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

---

## <a id='pw-authentication-fails'></a> Password authentication fails

SCST - Store does not start. You see the following error in the
`metadata-store-app` pod logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs pod/metadata-store-app-* -n metadata-store -c metadata-store-app
...
[error] failed to initialize database, got error failed to connect to `host=metadata-store-db user=metadata-store-user database=metadata-store`: server error (FATAL: password authentication failed for user "metadata-store-user" (SQLSTATE 28P01))
```

## Explanation

The database password has changed between deployments. This is not supported.

### Solution

Redeploy the app either with the original database password or follow the latter steps to erase the
data on the volume:

1. Deploy `metadata-store app` with kapp.

2. Verify that the `metadata-store-db-*` pod fails.

3. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl exec -it metadata-store-db-KUBERNETES-ID -n metadata-store /bin/bash
    ```

    Where `KUBERNETES-ID` is the ID generated by Kubernetes and appended to the pod name.

4. To delete all database data, run:

    ```console
    rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*
    ```

    This is the path found in `postgres-db-deployment.yaml`.

5. Delete the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

6. Deploy the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

---

## <a id='md-store-db-fail-to-start'></a> `metadata-store-db` pod fails to start

When SCST - Store is deployed, deleted, and then redeployed, the `metadata-store-db`
pod fails to start if the database password changed during redeployment.

### Explanation

The persistent volume used by `PostgreSQL` retains old data, even though the retention policy is set
to `DELETE`.

### Solution

Redeploy the app either with the original database password or follow the later steps to erase the
data on the volume:

1. Deploy `metadata-store app` with kapp.

2. Verify that the `metadata-store-db-*` pod fails.

3. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl exec -it metadata-store-db-KUBERNETES-ID -n metadata-store /bin/bash
    ```

    Where `KUBERNETES-ID` is the ID generated by Kubernetes and appended to the pod name.

4. To delete all database data, run:

    ```console
    rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*
    ```

    This is the path found in `postgres-db-deployment.yaml`.

5. Delete the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

6. Deploy the `metadata-store` app with kapp.

---

## <a id='missing-persistent-volume'></a> Missing persistent volume

After SCST - Store is deployed, `metadata-store-db` pod fails for missing volume
while `postgres-db-pv-claim` pvc is in the `PENDING` state.

### Explanation

The cluster where SCST - Store is deployed does not have `storageclass`
defined. The provisioner of `storageclass` is responsible for creating the persistent volume after
`metadata-store-db` attaches `postgres-db-pv-claim`.

### Solution

1. Verify that your cluster has `storageclass` by running:

    ```console
    kubectl get storageclass
    ```

2. Create a `storageclass` in your cluster before deploying SCST - Store. For example:

    ```console
    # This is the storageclass that Kind uses
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/master/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml

    # set the storage class as default
    kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
     ```

## <a id='connect-aws-eks-clusters'></a> Failure to connect Tanzu CLI to AWS EKS clusters

When using the Tanzu CLI to connect to AWS EKS clusters, you might see one of the following errors:

- `Error: Unable to connect: connection refused. Confirm kubeconfig details and try again`
- `invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"`

### Explanation

The cause is [Kubernetes v1.24](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/)
dropping support for `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1`.
For more information, see [aws/aws-cli/issues/6920](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/6920) in
GitHub.

### Solution

Follow these steps to update your `aws-cli` to a supported v2.7.35 or later, and update the
`kubeconfig` entry for your EKS clusters:

1. Update `aws-cli` to the latest version. For more information see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

2. Update the `kubeconfig` entry for your EKS clusters:

    ```console
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${REGION}
    ```

3. In a new terminal window, run a Tanzu CLI command to verify the connection issue is resolved.
   For example:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload list
    ```

    Expect the command to execute without error.

## <a id='invalid-repo-paths'></a> Invalid repository paths are propagated

When inputting `shared.image_registry.project_path`, invalid repository paths are propagated.

### Explanation

The key `shared.image_registry.project_path`, which takes input as `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME`, cannot
take "/" at the end of the string.

### Solution

Do not append "/" to the end of the string.

---

## <a id='cluster-issuer-trust-issues'></a> x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

### Explanation

Tanzu Application Platform v1.4 introduces [Shared Ingress Issuer](../release-notes.hbs.md#1-4-0-tap-new-features) to secure ingress communication by default.
The Certificate Authority for Shared Ingress Issuer is generated as self-signed. As a result, you might see one of the following errors:

- `connection refused`
- `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

### Solution

You can choose one of the following options to mitigate the issue:

#### Option 1: Configure the Shared Ingress Issuer's Certificate Authority as a trusted Certificate Authority

>**Important** This is the recommended option for a secure instance.

Follow these steps to trust the Shared Ingress Issuer's Certificate Authority in Tanzu Application Platform:

1. Extract the ClusterIssuer's Certificate Authority.

    For default installations where `ingress_issuer` is not set in `tap_values.yml`,
    you can extract the ClusterIssuer's Certificate Authority from cert-manager:

    ```console
    kubectl get secret tap-ingress-selfsigned-root-ca -n cert-manager -o yaml | yq .data | cut -d' ' -f2 | head -1 | base64 -d
    ```

    If you overrode the default `ingress_issuer` while installing Tanzu Application Platform,
    you must refer to your issuer's documentation to extract your ClusterIssuer's Certificate Authority instead of using the command above.

1. Add the certificate to the list of trusted certificate authorities by appending the certificate authority to the `shared.ca_cert_data` field in your `tap-values.yml`.

1. Reapply your configuration:

    ```console
    tanzu package install tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v ${TAP_VERSION} --values-file tap-values.yml -n tap-install
    ```

#### Option 2: Deactivate the shared ingress issuer

>**Important** This option is recommended for testing purposes only.

Follow these steps to deactivate TLS for Cloud Native Runtimes, AppSSO and Tanzu Developer Portal:

1. Set `shared.ingress_issuer` to `""` in your `tap-values.yml`:

    ```yaml
    shared:
      ingress_issuer: ""
    ```

1. Reapply your configuration:

    ```console
    tanzu package install tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v ${TAP_VERSION} --values-file tap-values.yml -n tap-install
    ```
