# Create Azure Resources for Tanzu Application Platform

To install Tanzu Application Platform within Azure ecosystem, you must create several Azure resources. 
This topic walks you through creating:

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to install Tanzu Application Platform.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to allow authentication and
  authorization to read and write from Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- ACR repositories for the Tanzu Application Platform container images.

Creating these resources enables Tanzu Application Platform to use an IAM role 
bound to a Kubernetes service account for authentication, rather than the typical 
username and password stored in a Kubernetes secret strategy. 

This is important when using ACR because authenticating to ACR is a two-step process:

1. Retrieve a token using your Azure credentials.
1. Use the token to authenticate to the registry.

To increase security, the token has a lifetime of 12 hours. This makes storing 
it as a secret for a service impractical because it must be refreshed every 12 hours.

Using an IAM role on a service account mitigates the need to retrieve the token 
because it is handled by credential helpers within the services.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

Before installing Tanzu Application Platform on Azure, you need:

- **An Azure subscription:**

    You must create all of your resources within
    an [Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing) and create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
  
- **Azure CLI:**

    To run CLI reference commands locally, you must [install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    This topic uses Azure CLI to both query and configure resources in Azure, such as IAM roles.
    For more information, see [Azure CLI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).


## <a id='azure-resource-group'></a>Create Azure Resource Group

1. Log in to Azure.

    ```console
    az login
    az account set --subscription SUBSCRIPTION-NAME
    ```

1. Create a resource group with the `az group create` command.

    ```console
    az group create --name myTAPResourceGroup --location eastus
    ```

## <a id='create-aks-cluster'></a>Create an AKS cluster

To create an AKS cluster, you can run the [az aks create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create) 
command with the `--enable-addons monitoring` and `--enable-msi-auth-for-monitoring` 
parameter to enable [Azure Monitor Container insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) 
with managed identity authentication (preview). 

The following example creates a cluster named `tap-on-azure` with one node and 
enables a system-assigned managed identity:

```console
az aks create -g myTAPResourceGroup -n tap-on-azure --enable-managed-identity --node-count 6 --enable-addons monitoring --enable-msi-auth-for-monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size Standard_D4ds_v4 --kubernetes-version KUBERNETES_VERSION
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

> **Note** When you create an AKS cluster, a second resource group is automatically 
created to store the AKS resources. 
For more information, see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/faq#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

## <a id='connect-aks-cluster'></a>Connect to the AKS cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client, 
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/). 
`kubectl` is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

1. Install `kubectl` locally by using the 
  [az aks install-cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command:

    ```console
    az aks install-cli
    ```

1. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster by using the 
  [az aks get-credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command that:

    - Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
    - Uses `~/.kube/config`, the default location for the [Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). 
    You can specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file by using the `--file` argument.

    ```console
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group myTAPResourceGroup --name tap-on-azure
    ```
