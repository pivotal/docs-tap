# Overview of Convention Service

The [Cartographer Conventions](../cartographer-conventions/about.md) component must be installed to add conventions to your Pod.
The v0.07.0 version of the convention controller is a passive system that translates the CRDs to the [new group](../cartographer-conventions/reference/pod-intent.md).

>**Caution:** This component is being deprecated in favor of [Cartographer Conventions](../cartographer-conventions/about.md).
