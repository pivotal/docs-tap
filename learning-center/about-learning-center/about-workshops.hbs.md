# About Learning Center workshops

This topic gives you an overview of Learning Center workshops.

The Learning Center workshop dashboard comprises a set of workshop instructions on the
left-hand side and a series of tabbed views on the right-hand side.
For workshops that require users to run commands, one or more terminal shells are provided.
For more information about workshops including creating your own, see [Create workshops](../workshop-content/about.md).

The terminals provide access to the editors `vi` and `nano`. To provide a UI based editor, you can
enable the embedded editor view and use the embedded IDE based on VS Code.

To complement the workshop instructions, or to be available for use by the instructor, you can include slides with a
workshop. For slides you can use HTML based slide presentation tools such as `reveal.js`, or you can embed a PDF file.

If the workshop involves working with Kubernetes, you can enable a web console for accessing the Kubernetes cluster.
The default web console uses the Kubernetes dashboard.

Alternatively, you can enable Octant as the web console.
