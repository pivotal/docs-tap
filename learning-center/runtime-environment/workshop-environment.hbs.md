# Configure the WorkshopEnvironment resource

This topic describes how you configure the `WorkshopEnvironment` custom resource, which defines a
Learning Center workshop environment.

## <a id="spec-workshop-definition"></a>Specifying the workshop definition

Creating a workshop environment is performed as a separate step to loading the workshop definition. This allows multiple distinct workshop environments using the same workshop definition to be created if necessary.

To specify which workshop definition is to be used for a workshop environment, set the `workshop.name` field of the specification for the workshop environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
```

The workshop environment name specified in the workshop environment metadata does not need to be the same. It has to be different if you create multiple workshop environments from the same workshop definition.

When the workshop environment is created, the namespace created for the workshop environment uses the `name` specified in the `metadata`. This name is also used in the unique names of each workshop instance created under the workshop environment.

## <a id="override-env-vars"></a>Overriding environment variables

A workshop definition can set a list of environment variables that must be set for all workshop instances. To override an environment variable specified in the workshop definition. or one defined in the container image, you can supply a list of environment variables as `session.env`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    env:
    - name: REPOSITORY-URL
      value: YOUR-GIT-URL-FOR-LAB-MARKDOWN-SAMPLE
```

Where `YOUR-GIT-URL-FOR-LAB-MARKDOWN-SAMPLE` is the Git repository URL for `lab-markdown-sample`. For example, `{YOUR-GIT-REPO-URL}/lab-markdown-sample`.

You can use this to set the location of a back-end service, such as an image registry, used by the workshop.

Values of fields in the list of resource objects can reference several predefined parameters. The available parameters are:

- `session_ ` - A unique ID for the workshop instance within the workshop environment.
- `session_ ` - The namespace created for and bound to the workshop instance. This is the namespace unique to the session and where a workshop can create its own resources.
- `environment_ ` - The name of the workshop environment. Currently, this is the same as the name of the namespace for the workshop environment. It is suggested that you do not rely on workshop environment name and namespace being the same, and use the most appropriate to cope with any future change.
- `workshop_ ` - The namespace for the workshop environment. This is the namespace where all deployments of the workshop instances are created and where the workshop instance runs the service account exists.
- `service_ ` - The workshop instance service account's name and access to the namespace created for that workshop instance.
- `ingress_ ` - The host domain under which host names are created when creating ingress routes.
- `ingress_ ` - The protocol (http/https) used for ingress routes created for workshops.

The syntax for referencing one of the parameters is `$(parameter_name)`.

## <a id="override-ingress-domain"></a>Overriding the ingress domain

To access a workshop instance using a public URL, you must specify an ingress domain. If an ingress domain is not specified, the default ingress domain that the Learning Center operator configured with is used.

When setting a custom domain, DNS must be configured with a wildcard domain to forward all requests for subdomains of the custom domain to the ingress router of the Kubernetes cluster.

To provide the ingress domain, you can set the `session.ingress.domain` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    ingress:
      domain: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
```

By default, the workshop session is exposed using an HTTP connection if overriding the domain. If you require a secure HTTPS connection, you must have access to a wildcard SSL certificate for the domain. A secret of type `tls` must be created for the certificate in the `learningcenter` namespace or the namespace where the Learning Center Operator is deployed. The name of that secret must then be set in the `session.ingress.secret` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    ingress:
      domain: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      secret: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com-tls
```

If HTTPS connections are terminated using an external load balancer and not by specifying a secret for ingresses managed by the Kubernetes ingress controller, then routing traffic into the Kubernetes cluster as HTTP connections, you can override the ingress protocol without specifying an ingress secret by setting the `session.ingress.protocol` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    ingress:
      domain: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      protocol: https
```

To override or set the ingress class, which dictates which ingress router is used when more than one option is available, you can add `session.ingress.class`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    ingress:
      domain: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      secret: training.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com-tls
      class: nginx
```

## <a id="control-access-to-ws"></a>Controlling access to the workshop

By default, requesting a workshop using the `WorkshopRequest` custom resource is deactivated and must be enabled for a workshop environment by setting `request.enabled` to `true`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  request:
    enabled: true
```

With this enabled, anyone who can create a `WorkshopRequest` custom resource can request the creation of a workshop instance for the workshop environment.

To further control who can request a workshop instance in the workshop environment, you can first set an access token, which a user must know and supply with the workshop request. This is done by setting the `request.token` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  request:
    enabled: true
    token: lab-markdown-sample
```

The same name as the workshop environment is used in this example, which is probably not a good practice. Use a random value instead. The token value may be multiline.

As a second control measure, you can specify what namespaces the `WorkshopRequest` must be created. This means a user must have the specific ability to create `WorkshopRequest` resources in one of those namespaces.

You can specify the list of namespaces from which workshop requests for the workshop environment by setting `request.namespaces`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  request:
    enabled: true
    token: lab-markdown-sample
    namespaces:
    - default
```

To add the workshop namespace in the list, rather than list the literal name, you can reference a predefined parameter specifying the workshop namespace by including `$(workshop_namespace)`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  request:
    enabled: true
    token: lab-markdown-sample
    namespaces:
    - $(workshop_namespace)
```

## <a id="override-login-creds"></a>Overriding the login credentials

When requesting a workshop using `WorkshopRequest`, a login dialog box is presented to the user when accessing the workshop instance URL. By default, the user name is `learningcenter`. The password is a random value the user must query from the `WorkshopRequest` status after creating the custom resource.

To override the user name, you can set the `session.username` field. To set the same fixed password for all workshop instances, you can set the `session.password` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  session:
    username: workshop
    password: lab-markdown-sample
```

## <a id="extra-workshop-resources"></a>Additional workshop resources

The workshop definition defined by the `Workshop` custom resource already declares a set of resources to be created with the workshop environment. You can use this when you have shared service applications the workshop needs, such as an container image registry or a Git repository server.

To deploy additional applications related to a specific workshop environment, you can declare them by adding them into the `environment.objects` field of the `WorkshopEnvironment` custom resource. You might use this deploy a web application used by attendees of a workshop to access their workshop instances.

For namespaced resources, it is not necessary to set the `namespace` field of the resource `metadata`. When the `namespace` field is not present, the resource is created within the workshop namespace for that workshop environment.

When resources are created, owner references are added, making the `WorkshopEnvironment` custom resource correspond to the owner of the workshop environment. This means that any resources are also deleted when the workshop environment is deleted.

Values of fields in the list of resource objects can reference several predefined parameters. The available parameters are:

- `workshop_ ` - The name of the workshop. This is the name of the `Workshop` definition the workshop environment was created against.
- `environment_ ` - The name of the workshop environment. Currently, this is the same as the name of the namespace for the workshop environment. Do not rely on the name and the workshop environment being the same, and use the most appropriate to cope with any future change.
- `environment_ ` - The token value must be used against the workshop environment in workshop requests.
- `workshop_ ` - The namespace for the workshop environment. This is the namespace where all deployments of the workshop instances and their service accounts are created. It is the same namespace that shared workshop resources are created.
- `service_ ` - The service account name is used when creating deployments in the workshop namespace.
- `ingress_ ` - The host domain under which host names are created when creating ingress routes.
- `ingress_ ` - The protocol (http/https) used for ingress routes created for workshops.
- `ingress_ ` - The name of the ingress secret stored in the workshop namespace when secure ingress is being used.

To create additional namespaces associated with the workshop environment, embed a reference to `$(workshop_namespace)` in the name of the additional namespaces, with an appropriate suffix. Be mindful that the suffix doesn't overlap with the range of session IDs for workshop instances.

When creating deployments in the workshop namespace, set the `serviceAccountName` of the `Deployment` resource to `$(service_account)`. This ensures the deployment uses a special Pod security policy set up by the Learning Center. If this isn't used and the cluster imposes a more strict default Pod security policy, your deployment might not work, especially if any image expects to run as `root`.

## <a id="create-workshop-instances"></a>Creation of workshop instances

After a workshop environment is created, you can create the workshop instances. You can request a workshop instance by using the `WorkshopRequest` custom resource. This can be a separate step, or you can add them as resources under `environment.objects`.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: WorkshopEnvironment
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshop:
    name: lab-markdown-sample
  request:
    token: lab-markdown-sample
    namespaces:
    - $(workshop_namespace)
  session:
    username: learningcenter
    password: lab-markdown-sample
  environment:
    objects:
    - apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
      kind: WorkshopRequest
      metadata:
        name: user1
      spec:
        environment:
          name: $(environment_name)
          token: $(environment_token)
    - apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
      kind: WorkshopRequest
      metadata:
        name: user2
      spec:
        environment:
          name: $(environment_name)
          token: $(environment_token)
```

Using this method, the workshop environment is populated with workshop instances. You can query the workshop requests from the workshop namespace to discover the URLs for accessing each and the password if you didn't set one and a random password was assigned.

If you need more control over how the workshop instances were created using this method, you can use the `WorkshopSession` custom resource instead.
