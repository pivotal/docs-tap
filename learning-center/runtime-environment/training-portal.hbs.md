# Configure the TrainingPortal resource

This topic describes how you configure the `TrainingPortal` custom resource, which triggers the
deployment of a set of Learning Center workshop environments and a set number of workshop instances.

## <a id="specify-workshop-defs"></a> Specifying the workshop definitions

You run multiple workshop instances to perform training to a group of people by creating the workshop environment and then creating each workshop instance. The `TrainingPortal` workshop resource bundles that up as one step.

Before creating the training environment, you must load the workshop definitions as a separate step.

To specify the names of the workshops to be used for the training, list them under the `workshops` field of the training portal specification. Each entry needs to define a `name` property, matching the name of the `Workshop` resource you created.

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
```

When the training portal is created, it:

- Sets up the underlying workshop environments.
- Creates any workshop instances required to be created initially for each workshop.
- Deploys a web portal for attendees of the training to access their workshop instances.

## <a id="limit-number-of-sessions"></a>Limit the number of sessions

When defining the training portal, you can set a limit on the workshop sessions that can be run concurrently. Set this limit by using the `portal.sessions.maximum` property:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
```

When you specify this, the maximum capacity of each workshop is set to the maximum value for the training portal as a whole. This means that any one workshop can have as many sessions running as specified by the maximum for the portal. However, to achieve this maximum for a given workshop, only instances of that workshop can be created. In other words, the maximum capacity can be spread across a number of workshops or it can be used in its entirety by a single workshop.

If you do not set `portal.sessions.maximum`, you must set the capacity for each individual workshop as detailed in the following section. In only setting the capacities of each workshop and not an overall maximum for sessions, you cannot share the overall capacity of the training portal across multiple workshops.

## <a id="cap-individual-workshops"></a> Capacity of individual workshops

When you have more than one workshop, you can want to limit how many instances of each workshop you can have so that they cannot grow to the maximum number of sessions for the whole training portal. This means you can stop a specific workshop from using all of the capacity of the training portal. To do this, set the `capacity` field under the entry for the workshop:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
    capacity: 4
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 6
```

The value of `capacity` limits the number of workshop sessions for a specific workshop to that value. It must be less than or equal to the maximum number of workshops sessions for the portal, because the latter always sets the absolute limit.

## <a id="set-reserved-ws-instances"></a> Set reserved workshop instances

By default one instance of each of the listed workshops is created so when the initial user requests that workshop, it's available for use immediately.

When such a reserved instance is allocated to a user, provided that the workshop capacity hasn't been reached, a new instance of the workshop is created as a reserve ready for the next user. When a user ends a workshop and the workshop is at capacity, when the instance is deleted, a new reserve is created. The total of allocated and reserved sessions for a workshop cannot exceed the capacity for that workshop.

To override for a specific workshop how many reserved instances are kept on standby ready for users, you can set the `reserved` setting against the workshop:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
    capacity: 4
    reserved: 2
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 6
    reserved: 4
```

You can set the value of `reserved` to 0 if you never want any reserved instances for a workshop and only want instances of that workshop created on demand when required for a user. Creating instances of a workshop on demand can result in a user waiting longer to access a workshop session.

When workshop instances are always created on demand, the oldest reserved instance is terminated to allow a new session of a desired workshop to be created. This also happens when reserved instances tie up capacity that could be used for a new session of another workshop. This occurs if any caps for specific workshops are met.

## <a id="override-init-num-session"></a> Override initial number of sessions

The initial number of workshop instances created for each workshop is specified by `reserved` or 1 if the setting hasn't been provided.

In the case where `reserved` is set in order to keep workshop instances on standby, you can indicate that initially you want more than the reserved number of instances created. This is useful when running a workshop for a set period of time. You might create up-front instances of the workshop corresponding to 75% of the expected number of attendees but with a smaller reserve number. With this configuration, new reserve instances only start to be created when the total number approaches 75% and all extra instances created up front have been allocated to users. This ensures you have enough instances ready for when most people come, but you can also create other instances later if necessary:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-fundamentals
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 100
  workshops:
  - name: lab-kubernetes-fundamentals
    initial: 75
    reserved: 5
```

## <a id="set-defaults-for-ws"></a> Setting defaults for all workshops

If you have a list of workshops, and they all must be set with the same values for `capacity`, `reserved`, and `initial`, rather than add settings to each, you can set defaults to apply to all workshops under the `portal` section:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 10
    capacity: 6
    reserved: 2
    initial: 4
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
```



## <a id="set-user-caps"></a>Set caps on individual users

By default a single user can run more than one workshop at a time. You can cap this to ensure that workshops run only one at a time. This prevents a user from wasting resources by starting more than one workshop and only working on one without shutting the other down.

To apply a limit on how many concurrent workshop sessions a user can start, use the `portal.sessions.registered` setting:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
      registered: 1
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
    capacity: 4
    reserved: 2
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 6
    reserved: 4
```

This limit also applies to anonymous users when anonymous access is enabled through the training portal web interface or if sessions are being created through the REST API. To set a limit on anonymous users, you can set `portal.sessions.anonymous` instead:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: sample-workshops
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
      anonymous: 1
  workshops:
  - name: lab-asciidoc-sample
    capacity: 4
    reserved: 2
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 6
    reserved: 4
```

## <a id="expiring-of-ws-sessions"></a>Expiration of workshop sessions

After you reach the maximum capacity, no more workshops sessions can be created. After a workshop session is allocated to a user, it cannot be reassigned to another user.

If you are running a supervised workshop, set the capacity higher than the anticipated number of users in case you have more users than you expect. Use the setting for the reserved number of instances. This way, even if you set a higher capacity than needed, workshop sessions are only created as required and not all up front.

In supervised workshops, when the training is over, delete the whole training environment. All workshop sessions are then deleted.

To host a training portal over an extended period but don't know when users want to do a workshop, you can set up workshop sessions to expire after a set time. When expired, the workshop session is deleted and a new workshop session can be created in its place.

The maximum capacity is therefore the maximum at any one point in time, while the number can grow and shrink over time. So over an extended time, you can handle many more sessions than the set maximum capacity. The maximum capacity ensures you don't try to allocate more workshop sessions than you have resources for at a given time.

To set a maximum time allowed for a workshop session, use the `expires` setting:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 8
    reserved: 1
    expires: 60m
```

The value needs to be an integer, followed by a suffix of 's', 'm' or 'h', corresponding to seconds, minutes, or hours.

The time period is calculated from when the workshop session is allocated to a user. When the time period is up, the workshop session is automatically deleted.

When an expiration period is specified, or when a user finishes a workshop or restarts the workshop, the workshop is also deleted.

To cope with users who claim a workshop session, but leave and don't use it, you can set a time period for when a workshop session with no activity is deemed orphaned and so is deleted. Do this using the `orphaned` setting:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 8
    reserved: 1
    expires: 60m
    orphaned: 5m
```

Avoid this setting for supervised workshops where the whole event only lasts a certain length of time. This prevents a user's session from being deleted when the user takes breaks and the computer goes to sleep.

The `expires` and `orphaned` settings can also be set against `portal` to apply them to all workshops.

## <a id="updates-to-ws-env"></a> Updates to workshop environments

The list of workshops for an existing training portal can be changed by modifying the training portal definition applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

If you remove a workshop from the list of workshops, the workshop environment is marked as stopping and is deleted when all active workshop sessions have completed.

If you add a workshop to the list of workshops, a new workshop environment for it is created.

Changes to settings, such as the maximum number of sessions for the training portal or capacity settings for individual workshops, are applied to existing workshop environments.

By default a workshop environment is left unchanged if the corresponding workshop definition is changed. So in the default configuration, you must explicitly delete the workshop from the list of workshops managed by the training portal and then add it back again if the workshop definition changed.

If you prefer that workshop environments be replaced when the workshop definition changes, enable this by using the `portal.updates.workshop` setting:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    sessions:
      maximum: 8
    updates:
      workshop: true
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    reserved: 1
    expires: 60m
    orphaned: 5m
```

When using this option, use the `portal.sessions.maximum` setting to limit the number of workshop sessions that can be run for the training portal as a whole. When replacing the workshop environment, the old workshop environment is retained if there is still an active workshop session being used. If the limit isn't set, the new workshop environment is still able to grow to its specific capacity and is not limited by how many workshop sessions are running against old instances of the workshop environment.

Overall, VMware recommends updating workshop environments when workshop definitions change only in development environments when working on workshop content. This is an especially good practice until you are familiar with how the training portal replaces existing workshop environments, and the resource implications of having old and new instances of a workshop environment running at the same time.

## <a id="override-ingress-domain"></a>Override the ingress domain

To access a workshop instance using a public URL, specify an ingress domain. If an ingress domain isn't specified, the default ingress domain that the Learning Center Operator is configured with is used.

When setting a custom domain, DNS must have been configured with a wildcard domain to forward all requests for sub-domains of the custom domain to the ingress router of the Kubernetes cluster.

To provide the ingress domain, set the `portal.ingress.domain` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    ingress:
      domain: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

If overriding the domain, by default the workshop session is exposed using a HTTP connection. For a secure HTTPS connection, you must have access to a wildcard SSL certificate for the domain. A secret of type `tls` should be created for the certificate in the `learningcenter` namespace or the namespace where the Learning Center Operator is deployed. The name of that secret must be set in the `portal.ingress.secret` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    ingress:
      domain: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      secret: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com-tls
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

You can terminate HTTPS connections by using an external load balancer instead of specifying a secret for ingresses managed by the Kubernetes ingress controller. In that case, when routing traffic into the Kubernetes cluster as HTTP connections, you can override the ingress protocol without specifying an ingress secret. Instead, set the `portal.ingress.protocol` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    ingress:
      domain: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      protocol: https
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

To override or set the ingress class, which dictates which ingress router is used when more than one option is available, you can add `portal.ingress.class`:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    ingress:
      domain: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      secret: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com-tls
      class: nginx
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

## <a id="override-portal-hostname"></a>Override the portal host name

The default host name given to the training portal is the name of the resource with `-ui` suffix, followed by the domain specified by the resource or the default inherited from the configuration of the Learning Center Operator.

To override the generated host name, you can set `portal.ingress.hostname`:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    ingress:
      hostname: labs
      domain: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com
      secret: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com-tls
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

This causes the host name to be `labs.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com` rather than the default generated name for this example of `lab-markdown-sample-ui.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com`.

## <a id="set-extra-env-variables"></a>Set extra environment variables

To override any environment variables for workshop instances created for a specific work, provide the environment variables in the `env` field of that workshop:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
    env:
    - name: REPOSITORY-URL
      value: YOUR-GIT-URL-FOR-LAB-MARKDOWN-SAMPLE
```

Where `YOUR-GIT-URL-FOR-LAB-MARKDOWN-SAMPLE` is the Git repository URL for `lab-markdown-sample`. For example, `{YOUR-GIT-REPO-URL}/lab-markdown-sample`.

Values of fields in the list of resource objects can reference a number of predefined parameters. The available parameters are:

- `session_id` - A unique ID for the workshop instance within the workshop environment.
- `session_namespace` - The namespace created for and bound to the workshop instance. This is the namespace unique to the session and where a workshop can create its own resources.
- `environment_name` - The name of the workshop environment. For now this is the same as the name of the namespace for the workshop environment. Don't rely on them being the same, and use the most appropriate to cope with any future change.
- `workshop_namespace` - The namespace for the workshop environment. This is the namespace where all deployments of the workshop instances are created and where the service account that the workshop instance runs as exists.
- `service_account` - The name of the service account the workshop instance runs as and which has access to the namespace created for that workshop instance.
- `ingress_domain` - The host domain under which host names can be created when creating ingress routes.
- `ingress_protocol` - The protocol (http/https) used for ingress routes created for workshops.

The syntax for referencing one of the parameters is `$(parameter_name)`.

## <a id="override-portal-creds"></a>Override portal credentials

When a training portal is deployed, the user name for the admin and robot accounts uses the defaults of `learningcenter` and `robot@learningcenter`. The passwords for each account are randomly set.

For the robot account, the OAuth application client details used with the REST API are also randomly generated.

You can see what the credentials and client details are by running `kubectl describe` against the training portal resource. This will yield output that includes:

```console
Status:
  learningcenter:
    Clients:
      Robot:
        Id:      ACZpcaLIT3qr725YWmXu8et9REl4HBg1
        Secret:  t5IfXbGZQThAKR43apoc9usOFVDv2BLE
    Credentials:
      Admin:
        Password:  0kGmMlYw46BZT2vCntyrRuFf1gQq5ohi
        Username:  learningcenter
      Robot:
        Password:  QrnY67ME9yGasNhq2OTbgWA4RzipUvo5
        Username:  robot@learningcenter
```

To override any of these values to set them to a predetermined value, you can add `credentials` and `clients` sections to the training portal specification.

To overload the credentials for the admin and robot accounts user:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    credentials:
      admin:
        username: admin-user
        password: top-secret
      robot:
        username: robot-user
        password: top-secret
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

To override the application client details for OAuth access by the robot account user:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    clients:
      robot:
        id: application-id
        secret: top-secret
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

## <a id="control-reg-type"></a>Control registration type

By default the training portal web interface presents a registration page for users to create an account before selecting a workshop. If you want to allow only the administrator to log in, you can deactivate the registration page. Do this if you are using the REST API to create and allocate workshop sessions from a separate application:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    registration:
      type: one-step
      enabled: false
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

If rather than requiring users to register, you want to allow anonymous access, you can switch the registration type to anonymous:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    registration:
      type: anonymous
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

When a user visits the training portal home page in anonymous mode, an account for that user is
automatically created and the user is logged in.

## <a id="specify-event-access-code"></a> Specify an event access code

When deploying the training portal with anonymous access or open registration, anyone who knows the URL can access workshops. To at least restrict access to those who know a common event access code or password, you can set `portal.password`:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    password: workshops-2020-07-01
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

When anonymous access is enabled and the training portal URL is accessed, users are asked to enter an event access code before they are redirected to the list of workshops or to the login page.

## <a id="make-list-of-ws-public"></a>Make a list of workshops public

By default the index page providing the catalog of available workshop images is only available after a user has logged in, either through a registered account or as an anonymous user.

To make the catalog of available workshops public so they can be viewed before logging in, set the `portal.catalog.visibility` property:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    catalog:
      visibility: public
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

By default the catalog has visibility set to `private`. Use `public` to expose it.

This also makes it possible to access the list of available workshops from the catalog through the REST API, without authenticating against the REST API.

## <a id="use-external-list-of-ws"></a>Use an external list of workshops

If you are using the training portal with registration deactivated, and you are using the REST API from a separate website to control creation of sessions, you can specify an alternate URL for providing the list of workshops.

This helps when the REST API creates a session and cookies are deleted or a session URL is shared with a different user. This means the value for the `index_url` supplied with the REST API request is lost.

To set the URL for the external site, use the `portal.index` property:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    index: https://www.example.com/
    registration:
      type: one-step
      enabled: false
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

If you supply this property, passing the `index_url` when creating a workshop session using the REST API is optional, and the value of this property is used. You can still supply `index_url` when using the REST API for a user to be redirected back to a sub-category of workshops on the site. The URL provided in the training portal definition then acts only as a fallback. That is, when the redirect URL becomes unavailable, it directs the user back to the top-level page for the external list of workshops.

If a user has logged into the training portal as the admin user, the user is not redirected to the external site and still sees the training portal's list of workshops.

## <a id="override-prtl-title-logo"></a>Override portal title and logo

By default the web interface for the training portal displays a generic Learning Center logo and a page title of "Workshops." To override these, you can set `portal.title` and `portal.logo`:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    title: Workshops
    logo: data:image/png;base64,....
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

The `logo` field should be a graphical image provided in embedded data URI format. The image is displayed with a fixed height of "40px". The field can also be a URL for an image stored on a remote web server.

## <a id="allow-portal-in-iframe"></a>Allow the portal in an iframe

By default it is prohibited to display the web interface for the training portal in an iframe of another web site, because of content security policies applying to the training portal website.

To enable the ability to iframe the full training portal web interface or even a specific workshop session created using the REST API, provide the host name of the site that embeds it. Do this by using the `portal.theme.frame.ancestors` property:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  portal:
    theme:
      frame:
        ancestors:
        - https://www.example.com
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

The property is a list of hosts, not a single value. To use a URL for the training portal in an iframe of a page, which, in turn, is embedded in another iframe of a page on a different site, list the host names of all sites.

Because the sites that embed iframes must be secure and use HTTPS, they cannot use plain HTTP. Browser policies prohibit promoting cookies to an insecure site when embedding using an iframe. If cookies cannot be stored, a user cannot authenticate against the workshop session.

## <a id="collect-analytics-on-ws"></a>Collect analytics on workshops

To collect analytics data on usage of workshops, supply a webhook URL. When you supply a webhook URL, events are posted to the webhook URL, including:

- Workshops started
- Pages of a workshop viewed
- Expiration of a workshop
- Completion of a workshop
- Termination of a workshop

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  analytics:
    webhook:
      url: https://metrics.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/?client=name&token=password
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

At present there is no metrics collection service compatible with the portal webhook reporting mechanism, so create a custom service or integrate it with any existing web front end for the portal REST API service.

If the collection service needs to be provided with a client ID or access token, it must accept using query string parameters set in the webhook URL.

Include the details of the event as HTTP POST data by using the `application/json` content type:

```json
{
  "portal": {
    "name": "lab-markdown-sample",
    "uid": "91dfa283-fb60-403b-8e50-fb30943ae87d",
    "generation": 3,
    "url": "https://lab-markdown-sample-ui.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com"
  },
  "event": {
    "name": "Session/Started",
    "timestamp": "2021-03-18T02:50:40.861392+00:00",
    "user": "c66db34e-3158-442b-91b7-25391042f037",

  }
}
```

When an event has associated data, it is included in the `data` dictionary:

```json
{
  "portal": {
    "name": "lab-markdown-sample",
    "uid": "91dfa283-fb60-403b-8e50-fb30943ae87d",
    "generation": 3,
    "url": "https://lab-markdown-sample-ui.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com"
  },
  "event": {
    "name": "Workshop/View",
    "timestamp": "2021-03-18T02:50:44.590918+00:00",
    "user": "c66db34e-3158-442b-91b7-25391042f037",
    "session": "lab-markdown-sample-w01-s001",
    "environment": "lab-markdown-sample-w01",
    "workshop": "lab-markdown-sample",
    "data": {
      "current": "workshop-overview",
      "next": "setup-environment",
      "step": 1,
      "total": 4
    }
  }
}
```

The `user` field is the same portal user identity returned by the REST API when creating workshop sessions.

The event stream only produces events for things as they happen. For a snapshot of all current workshop sessions, use the REST API to request the catalog of available workshop environments, enabling the inclusion of current workshop sessions.

## <a id="using-google-analytics"></a>Track using Google Analytics

To record analytics data on usage of workshops by using Google Analytics, enable tracking by supplying a tracking ID for Google Analytics:

```yaml
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: lab-markdown-sample
spec:
  analytics:
    google:
      trackingId: UA-XXXXXXX-1
  workshops:
  - name: lab-markdown-sample
    capacity: 3
    reserved: 1
```

Custom dimensions are used in Google Analytics to record details about the workshop a user is taking, including through which training portal and cluster it was accessed. So you can use the same Google Analytics tracking ID for multiple training portal instances running on different Kubernetes clusters.

To support use of custom dimensions in Google Analytics, configure the Google Analytics property with the following custom dimensions. They must be added in the order shown, because Google Analytics doesn't allow you to specify the index position for a custom dimension. It allocates them for you. You can't already have custom dimensions defined for the property, as the new custom dimensions must start at index of 1.


| Custom Dimension Name | Index |
|-----------------------|-------|
| workshop_name         | 1     |
| session_namespace     | 2     |
| workshop_namespace    | 3     |
| training_portal       | 4     |
| ingress_domain        | 5     |
| ingress_protocol      | 6     |

In addition to custom dimensions against page accesses, events are also generated. These include:

* Workshop/Start
* Workshop/Finish
* Workshop/Expired

If you provide a Google Analytics tracking ID with the `TrainingPortal` resource definition, it takes precedence over the `SystemProfile` resource definition.

>**Note** Google Analytics is not a reliable way to collect data. Individuals or corporate firewalls can block the reporting of Google Analytics data. For more precise statistics, use the webhook URL for collecting analytics with a custom data collection platform.
