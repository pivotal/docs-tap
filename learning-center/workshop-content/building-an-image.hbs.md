# Build an image for your Learning Center workshop

This topic describes how you include an extra system, third-party tool, or configuration in your image
by bundling workshop content from the Learning Center workshop base image.

The following sample workshop template provides a `Dockerfile`.

## <a id="structure-of-dockerfile"></a>Structure of the Dockerfile

The structure of the `Dockerfile` in the sample workshop template is:

```text
FROM registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages@sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

COPY --chown=1001:0 . /home/eduk8s/

RUN mv /home/eduk8s/workshop /opt/workshop

RUN fix-permissions /home/eduk8s
```

The default `Dockerfile` action is to:

- Copy all files from a registry to the `/home/eduk8s` directory.

  - You must build the custom workshop images on the base environment image according to the version
    of Tanzu Application Platform. To get the image ID, run:

      ```console
      kubectl get ds -n learningcenter learningcenter-prepull -o=jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.initContainers[0].image}"
      ```

      Example image ID:

      ```console
      registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages@sha256:a8870aa60b45495d298df5b65c69b3d7972608da4367bd6e69d6e392ac969dd4
      ```

  - You can build the workshop images directly on the base environment image, or you can create an
    intermediate base image to install extra packages required by a number of different workshops.

  - The `--chown=1001:0` option ensures that files are owned by the appropriate user and group.

- The `workshop` subdirectory is moved to `/opt/workshop` so that it is not visible to the user.
  This subdirectory is in an area searchable for workshop content, in addition to `/home/eduk8s/workshop`.

To customize your `Dockerfile`:

- You can ignore other files or directories from the repository, by listing them in the `.dockerignore` file.

- You can include `RUN` statements in the `Dockerfile` to run custom-build steps, but the `USER` inherited
  from the base image has user ID `1001` and is not the `root` user.

## <a id="custom-workshop-base-imgs"></a>Custom workshop base images

The `base-environment` workshop images include language run times for Node.js and Python. If you need a different language runtime or a different version of a language runtime, you must create a custom workshop base image which includes the environment you need. This custom workshop image is derived from `base-environment` but includes extra runtime components.

The following Dockerfile example creates a Java JDK11-customized image:

```text
ARG IMAGE_REPOSITORY=dev.registry.tanzu.vmware.com/learning-center
FROM ${IMAGE_REPOSITORY}/pkgs-java-tools as java-tools
FROM registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages@sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /opt/jdk11 /opt/java
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /opt/gradle /opt/gradle
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /opt/maven /opt/maven
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /opt/code-server/extensions/.  /opt/code-server/extensions/
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /home/eduk8s/. /home/eduk8s/
COPY --from=java-tools --chown=1001:0 /opt/eduk8s/. /opt/eduk8s/
ENV PATH=/opt/java/bin:/opt/gradle/bin:/opt/maven/bin:$PATH \
    JAVA_HOME=/opt/java \
    M2_HOME=/opt/maven
```


## <a id="install-extra-system-pkgs"></a>Installing extra system packages

Installing extra system packages requires that you run the installation as `root`. You must switch the user commands before running the command, and then switch the user back to user ID of `1001`.

```text
USER root

RUN ... commands to install system packages

USER 1001
```

VMware recommends that you only use the `root` user to install extra system packages. Don't use the `root` user when adding anything under `/home/eduk8s`. Otherwise, you must ensure the user ID and group for directories and files are set to `1001:0` and then run the `fix-permissions` command if necessary.

When you run any command as `root`, you must temporarily override the value of the `HOME` environment variable and set it to `/root`.

If you don't do this the `root` user drops configuration files in `/home/eduk8s`, thinking it is the `root` home directory, because the `HOME` environment variable is by default set to `/home/eduk8s`. This can cause commands run later during the workshop to fail if they try to update the configuration files as they have wrong permissions.

Fixing the file and group ownership and running `fix-permissions` can help with this problem, but not in every case, because of permissions the `root` user may apply and how container image layers work. VMware recommends that you use the following:

```text
USER root

RUN HOME=/root && \
    ... commands to install system packages

USER 1001
```

## <a id="install-third-party-pkgs"></a>Installing third-party packages

If you are not using system packaging tools to install extra packages, but are manually downloading packages and optionally compiling them to binaries, it is better to do this as the default user and not `root`.

If compiling packages, VMware recommends working in a temporary directory under `/tmp` and removing the directory as part of the same `RUN` statement when done.

If you are installing a binary, you can install it in `/home/eduk8s/bin`. This directory is in the application search path defined by the `PATH` environment variable for the image.

To install a directory hierarchy of files, create a separate directory under `/opt` to install everything. You can override the `PATH` environment variable in the `Dockerfile` to add an extra directory for application binaries and scripts. You can override the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable for the location of shared libraries.

If installing any files from a `RUN` instruction into `/home/eduk8s`, VMware recommends that you run `fix-permissions` as part of the same instruction to avoid copies of files being made into a new layer, which applies to the case where `fix-permissions` is only run in a later `RUN` instruction. You can still leave the final `RUN` instruction for `fix-permissions` as it is smart enough not to apply changes if the file permissions are already set correctly and so it does not trigger a copy of a file when run more than once.
