# Requirements for Learning Center in an air-gapped environment

This topic gives you the list of configurations required for Learning Center to properly
function in an air-gapped environment.

Learning Center can run in an air-gapped environment but workshops do not have this capability by default. Users must therefore take the following steps to ensure Learning Center functions as expected.

## <a id="workshop-yaml-changes"></a>Workshop yaml changes

In an air-gapped environment a user has no Internet access, so workshop yamls should be [modified](./workshop-content/building-an-image.md) to use:

1. Private container registries.
2. Private Maven, NPM, Python, Go, or any other language repository.

For example, in NPM you can modify the npmrc file to use:

```js
// .npmrc
registry=https://myregistry-url
```

## <a id="self-signed-certificates"></a>Self-signed certificates

Air-gapped environments normally use private Certificate Authorities (CA) that may require the use of self-signed certificates. You can allow the injection of CAs by:

1. Setting the env variable NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS to the path of the file that contains one or more trusted certificates in PEM format.
2. Add the following to your workshop definition:

    ```bash
    spec:
      session:
        env:
        - name: NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS
          value: "$my-cert-pathway"
    ```

## <a id="internet-dependencies"></a>Internet dependencies

If the workshop requires the installation of any Internet dependency, such as a Linux Tool or any other tool, it must be done in the workshop image. See [Build an image](./workshop-content/building-an-image.md)
