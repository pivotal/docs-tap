# Use client authentication for Learning Center

This topic describes how you can use the portal REST API to integrate access to workshops into an
existing website or to create a custom web interface for accessing workshops hosted across one or
more training portals.

The training portal web interface is a quick way of providing access to a set of workshops when
running a supervised training workshop.
The REST API gives you access to the list of workshops hosted by a training portal instance and allow
you to request and access workshop sessions. This bypasses the training portal's own user registration
and log in so you can implement whatever access controls you need.
This can include anonymous access or access integrated into an organization's single sign-on system.

## <a id="querying-credentials"></a>Querying the credentials

To provide access to the REST API, a robot account is automatically provisioned. Obtain the login credentials and details of the OAuth client endpoint used for authentication by querying the resource definition for the training portal after it is created and the deployment completed. If using `kubectl describe`, use:

```console
kubectl describe trainingportal.learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/<training-portal-name>
```

The status section of the output reads:

```console
Status:
  learningcenter:
    Clients:
      Robot:
        Id:      ACZpcaLIT3qr725YWmXu8et9REl4HBg1
        Secret:  t5IfXbGZQThAKR43apoc9usOFVDv2BLE
    Credentials:
      Admin:
        Password:  0kGmMlYw46BZT2vCntyrRuFf1gQq5ohi
        Username:  learningcenter
      Robot:
        Password:  QrnY67ME9yGasNhq2OTbgWA4RzipUvo5
        Username:  robot@learningcenter
```

Use the admin login credentials when you log in to the training portal web interface to access admin pages.

Use the robot login credentials if you want to access the REST API.

## <a id="requesting-access-token"></a>Requesting an access token

Before you can make requests against the REST API to query details about workshops or request a workshop session, you must log in through the REST API to get an access token.

This is done from any front-end web application or provisioning system, but the step is equivalent to making a REST API call by using `curl` of:

```console
curl -v -X POST -H \
"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "grant_type=password&username=robot@learningcenter&password=<robot-password>" \
-u "<robot-client-id>:<robot-client-secret>" \
<training-portal-url>/oauth2/token/
```

The URL sub path is `/oauth2/token/`.

Upon success, the output is a JSON response consisting of:

```console
{
    "access_token": "tg31ied56fOo4axuhuZLHj5JpUYCEL",
    "expires_in": 36000,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "user:info",
    "refresh_token": "1ryXhXbNA9RsTRuCE8fDAyZToJmp30"
}
```

## <a id="refreshing-access-token"></a>Refreshing the access token

The access token that is provided expires: it needs to be refreshed before it expires if in use by a long-running application.

To refresh the access token, use the equivalent of:

```console
curl -v -X POST -H \
"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<refresh-token>& \client_id=<robot-client-id>&client_secret=<robot-client-secret>" \
https://lab-markdown-sample-ui.test/oauth2/token/
```

As with requesting the initial access token, the URL sub path is `/oauth2/token/`.

The JSON response is of the same format as if a new token was requested.
