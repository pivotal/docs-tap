# Use session management for your Learning Center workshops

This topic describes how you use the REST API endpoints for session management, which allows you to
request a workshop session to be allocated.

## <a id="deactivate-portal-user-reg"></a>Deactivating portal user registration

When you use the REST API to trigger creation of workshop sessions, VMware recommends that you deactivate user registration through the training portal web interface. This means that only the admin user is able to directly access the web interface for the training portal.

```console
apiVersion: learningcenter.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: TrainingPortal
metadata:
  name: learningcenter-tutorials
spec:
  portal:
    registration:
      type: one-step
      enabled: false
  workshops:
  ...
```

## <a id="request-workshop-session"></a>Requesting a workshop session

The form of the URL sub path for requesting the allocation of a workshop environment by using the REST API is `/workshops/environment/<name>/request/`. The name segment must be replaced with the name of the workshop environment. When making the request, the access token must be supplied in the HTTP `Authorization` header with type set as `Bearer`:

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
<training-portal-url>/workshops/environment/<name>/request/?index_url=https://hub.test/
```

You can supply a query string parameter, `index_url`. When you restart the workshop session from the workshop environment web interface, the session is deleted and the user is redirected to the supplied URL. This URL is that of your front end web application that has requested the workshop session, allowing users to select a different workshop.

The value of the `index_url` is not available if session cookies are cleared or a session URL is shared with another user. In this case, a user is redirected back to the training portal URL instead. You can override the global default for this case by specifying the index URL as part of the `TrainingPortal` configuration.

When successful, the JSON response from the request is of the form:

```console
{
    "name": "educaes-tutorials-w01-s001",
    "user": "8d2d0c8b-6ff5-4244-b136-110fd8d8431a",
    "url": "/workshops/session/learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s001/activate/?token=6UIW4D8Bhf0egVmsEKYlaOcTywrpQJGi&index_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.test%2F",
    "workshop": "learningcenter-tutorials",
    "environment": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01",
    "namespace": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s001"
}
```

This includes the name of the workshop session, an ID for identifying the user, and both a URL path with an activation token and an index URL included as query string parameters.

Redirect the user's browser to this URL path on the training portal host. Accessing the URL activates the workshop session and then redirects the user to the workshop dashboard.

If the workshop session is not activated, which confirms allocation of the session, the session is deleted after 60 seconds.

When a user is redirected back to the URL for the index page, a query string parameter is supplied to give the reason the user is being returned. You can use this to display a banner or other indication as to why the user was returned.

The name of the query string parameter is `notification` and the possible values are:

* `session-deleted` - Used when the workshop session is completed or restarted.
* `workshop-invalid` - Used when the name of the workshop environment supplied while attempting to create the workshop is invalid.
* `session-unavailable` - Used when capacity is reached, and a workshop session cannot be created.
* `session-invalid` - Used when an attempt is made to access a session that doesn't exist. This can occur when the workshop dashboard is refreshed sometime after the workshop session expired and was deleted.

In prior versions, the name of the session was returned through the "session" property, whereas the "name" property is now used. To support older code using the REST API, the "session" property is still returned, but it is deprecated.

## <a id="associate-sessions-user"></a>Associating sessions with a user

When the workshop session is requested, a unique user account is created in the training portal each time. You can identify this account by using the `user` identifier, which is returned in the response.

The front end using the REST API to create workshop sessions can track user activity so that the training portal associates all workshop sessions created by the same user.
Supply the `user` identifier with subsequent requests by the same user in the request parameter:

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
https://lab-markdown-sample-ui.test/workshops/environment/<name>/request/?index_url=https://hub.test/&user=<user>
```

If the supplied ID matches a user in the training portal, the training portal uses it internally and returns the same value for `user` in the response.

When the user does match, and if there is already a workshop session allocated to the user for the workshop being requested, the training portal returns a link to the existing workshop session, rather than requesting that the user create a new workshop session.

If the user is not a match, possibly because the training portal was completely redeployed since the last time it was accessed, the training portal returns a new user identifier.

The first time you make a request to create a workshop session for a user where `user` is not supplied, you can optionally supply request parameters for the following to set these as the user details in the training portal.

* `email` - The email address of the user.
* `first_name` - The first name of the user.
* `last_name` - The last name of the user.

These details will be accessible through the admin pages of the training portal.

When sessions are associated with a user, you can query all active sessions for that user across the different workshops hosted by the instance of the training portal:

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
<training-portal-url>/workshops/user/<user>/sessions/
```

The response is of the form:

```console
{
  "user": "8d2d0c8b-6ff5-4244-b136-110fd8d8431a",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "name": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s001",
      "workshop": "learningcenter-tutorials",
      "environment": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01",
      "namespace": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s001",
      "started": "2020-07-31T03:57:33.942Z",
      "expires": "2020-07-31T04:57:33.942Z",
      "countdown": 3353,
      "extendable": false
    }
  ]
}
```

After a workshop has expired or has otherwise been shut down, the training portal no longer returns an entry for the workshop.

## <a id="list-workshop-sessions"></a> Listing all workshop sessions

To get a list of all running workshops sessions allocated to users, provide the `sessions=true` flag to the query string parameters of the REST API call. This lists the workshop environments available through the training portal.

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" |
<training-portal-url>/workshops/catalog/environments/?sessions=true
```

The JSON response is of the form:

```console
{
  "portal": {
    "name": "learningcenter-tutorials",
    "uid": "9b82a7b1-97db-4333-962c-97be6b5d7ee0",
    "generation": 476,
    "url": "<training-portal-url>",
    "sessions": {
      "maximum": 10,
      "registered": 0,
      "anonymous": 0,
      "allocated": 1
    }
  },
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01",
      "state": "RUNNING",
      "workshop": {
        "name": "lab-et-self-guided-tour",
        "id": "15e5f1a569496f335049bb00c370ee20",
        "title": "Workshop Building Tutorial",
        "description": "A guided tour of how to build a workshop for your team's learning center.",

        "authors": [],
        "difficulty": "",
        "duration": "",
        "tags": [],
        "logo": "",
        "url": "<workshop-repository-url>"
      },
      "duration": 1800,
      "capacity": 10,
      "reserved": 0,
      "allocated": 1,
      "available": 0,
      "sessions": [
        {
          "name": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s002",
          "state": "RUNNING",
          "namespace": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01-s002",
          "user": "672338f3-4085-4782-8d9b-ae1637e1c28c",
          "started": "2021-11-05T15:50:04.824Z",
          "expires": "2021-11-05T16:20:04.824Z",
          "countdown": 1737,
          "extendable": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

No workshop sessions are returned if anonymous access to this REST API endpoint is enabled and you are not authenticated against the training portal.

Only workshop environments with a `state` of `RUNNING` are returned by default. To see workshop environments that are shut down and any workshop sessions that still haven't been completed, supply the `state` query string parameter with value `STOPPING`.

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
<training-portal-url>/workshops/catalog/environments/?sessions=true&state=RUNNING&state=STOPPING
```

Include the `state` query string parameter more than once to see workshop environments in both `RUNNING` and `STOPPING` states.
