# Use the Learning Center workshop catalog

A single training portal can host one or more workshops. This topic describes how you use the
workshop catalog to list the available workshops and get information about them using the REST API.

## <a id="list-available-workshops"></a>Listing available workshops

The URL sub path for accessing the list of available workshop environments is `/workshops/catalog/environments/`. When making the request, you must supply the access token in the HTTP `Authorization` header with type set as `Bearer`:

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
<training-portal-url>/workshops/catalog/environments/
```

The JSON response looks like this:

```console
{
  "portal": {
    "name": "learningcenter-tutorials",
    "uid": "9b82a7b1-97db-4333-962c-97be6b5d7ee0",
    "generation": 451,
    "url": "<training_portal_url>",
    "sessions": {
      "maximum": 10,
      "registered": 0,
      "anonymous": 0,
      "allocated": 0
    }
  },
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "learningcenter-tutorials-w01",
      "state": "RUNNING",
      "workshop": {
        "name": "lab-et-self-guided-tour",
        "id": "15e5f1a569496f335049bb00c370ee20",
        "title": "Workshop Building Tutorial",
        "description": "A guided tour of how to build a workshop for your team's learning center.",
        "vendor": "",
        "authors": [],
        "difficulty": "",
        "duration": "",
        "tags": [],
        "logo": "",
        "url": "<workshop_repository_url>"
      },
      "duration": 1800,
      "capacity": 10,
      "reserved": 0,
      "allocated": 0,
      "available": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

For each workshop listed under `environments`, where a field listed under `workshop` has the same name as appears in the `Workshop` custom resource, it has the same meaning. The `id` field is an additional field that can uniquely identify a workshop based on the name of the workshop image, the Git repository for the workshop, or the website hosting the workshop instructions. The value of the `id` field does not rely on the name of the `Workshop` resource and must be the same if the same workshop details are used but the name of the `Workshop` resource is different.

The `duration` field provides the time in seconds after which the workshop environment expires. The value is `null` if there is no expiration time for the workshop.

The `capacity` field is the maximum number of workshop sessions that you can create for the workshop.

The `reserved` field indicates how many instances of the workshop are reserved as hot spares. These are used to service requests for a workshop session. If no reserved instances are available and capacity has not been reached, a new workshop session is created on demand.

The `allocated` field indicates how many workshop sessions are active and currently allocated to a user.

The `available` field indicates how many workshop sessions are available for immediate allocation. This is never more than the number of reserved instances.

Under `portal.sessions`, the `allocated` field indicates the total number of allocated sessions across all workshops hosted by the portal.

Where `maximum`, `registered`, and `anonymous` are nonzero, they are the limit on the number of workshops run.

  * The `maximum` is the total number of workshop sessions that can be run by the portal across all workshops. If `allocated` for the whole portal has reached `maximum`, no more workshop sessions are created.

  * The value of `registered` when nonzero indicates a cap on the number of workshop sessions a single registered portal user can have running at the one time.

  * The value of `anonymous` when nonzero indicates a cap on the number of workshop sessions an anonymous user can have running at the one time. Anonymous users are users created as a result of the REST API being used or if anonymous access is enabled when the user accesses the portal through the web interface.

By default, only workshop environments currently marked with a `state` of `RUNNING` are returned, that is, those workshop environments which are taking new workshop session requests. If you also want to see the workshop environments which are currently in the process of being shut down, you must provide the `state` query string parameter to the REST API call and indicate which states workshop environments to return for.

```console
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>" \
https://lab-markdown-sample-ui.test/workshops/catalog/environments/?state=RUNNING&state=STOPPING
```

You can include the `state` query string parameter more than once to see workshop environments in both `RUNNING` and `STOPPING` states.

If anonymous access to the list of workshop environments is enabled and you are not authenticated when using the REST API endpoint, only workshop environments in a running state are returned.
