# Overview of Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

VMware Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio is the official VMware Tanzu IDE extension for
Visual Studio 2022.
The extension helps you develop with Tanzu Application Platform and enables you to rapidly iterate
on your workloads on supported Kubernetes clusters that have Tanzu Application Platform installed.

Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio currently supports .NET C# applications.

This extension is for Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 only. It is incompatible with Visual Studio Code
and Visual Studio for Mac.

> **Note** This extension is in the beta stage of development.

## <a id="extension-features"></a> Extension features

The extension has the following features:

- **Deploy applications directly from Visual Studio**
  Rapidly iterate on your applications on Tanzu Application Platform and deploy them as workloads
  directly from within Visual Studio.

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**
  With the use of Live Update facilitated by Tilt, deploy your workload once, save changes to the code
  and then, seconds later, see those changes reflected in the workload running on the cluster.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster**
  Debug your application in a production-like environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster that
  has Tanzu Application Platform.
  An environment’s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies updated, among other
  variables.

- **Work with microservices in a Visual Studio solution**
  Work with multiple solution projects that represent discrete microservices.
  This makes it possible to deploy, debug, and Live Update multiple workloads simultaneously from the
  same solution.
