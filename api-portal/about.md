# Tanzu API portal

API portal for VMware Tanzu enables API consumers to find APIs they can use in their own applications. Consumers can view detailed API documentation and try out an API to see if it can meet their needs. API portal assembles its dashboard and detailed API documentation views by ingesting OpenAPI documentation from the source URLs. An API portal operator can add any number of OpenAPI source URLs in a single instance.
