### Known issues

This release has the following issues:


- **Image Policy Webhook:** If all webhook nodes or Pods are evicted by the cluster or scaled down, the admission policy blocks any Pods from being created in the cluster. To resolve the issue, the administrator needs to kubectl delete the Image Policy Webhook and reapply it once the cluster is stable.
- When you use the `Tanzu Developer Tools for VSCode` extension, delete the workload before performing any of the following actions. This will avoid workload update errors.
    - Switching between the `Live Update` & `Debug` capabilities
    - Disabling `Live Update` & re-starting `Live Update`

    You can do so by performing the following steps:
    1. Click the `Terminal` menu and select the `Run Task` option
    2. Type `tanzuWorkload delete` in the command palette that appears and hit enter
    3. View the Terminal tab to confirm that the Workload has been deleted

- Tanzu App CLI Plugin:
  - *`tanzu apps workload get`*: passing in `--output json` along with and the `--export` flag will return YAML rather than JSON (support for honoring the `--output json` in conjunction with `--export` will be added in the next release).
  - *`tanzu apps workload create/update/apply`*: when the `--wait` flag has been included and the "Do you want to create this workload?" prompt is declined, the command continues to wait rather exit


### Security issues

This release has the following security issue:

**In Learning Center, exported registry credentials are visible across namespaces:**
Because SecretExport CR allows you to export registry credentials to other namespaces, they are
visible to users of those namespaces.
VMware recommends that the registry credentials you export give read-only access to the registry and
have minimal scope within the registry.
