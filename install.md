# Installing the Tanzu Application Platform Package and Profiles

This document describes how to install Tanzu Application Platform packages
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

Before you install the packages, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites, configured
and verified the cluster, accepted the EULA, and installed the Tanzu CLI with any required plug-ins.
See [Installing Part I: Installing CLI](install-general.md).


## <a id='add-package-repositories-and-EULAs'></a> Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository

To add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository:

1. If you havenâ€™t already completed the Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu, this step is required. Set up environment variables for use during the installation.

    ```
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=TANZU-NET-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=TANZU-NET-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    ```

1. Create a namespace called `tap-install` for deploying any component packages by running:

    ```
    kubectl create ns tap-install
    ```

    This namespace keeps the objects grouped together logically.

1. Create a registry secret by running:

    ```
    tanzu secret registry add tap-registry \
      --username ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME} --password ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD} \
      --server ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME} \
      --export-to-all-namespaces --yes --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Add Tanzu Application Platform package repository to the cluster by running:

    ```
    tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:1.0.1 \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```
    For example:

    ```
    $ tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
        --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:1.0.1 \
        --namespace tap-install
    \ Adding package repository 'tanzu-tap-repository'...

    Added package repository 'tanzu-tap-repository'
    ```

1. Get the status of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

    ```
    tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```
    For example:

    ```
    $ tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    - Retrieving repository tap...
    NAME:          tanzu-tap-repository
    VERSION:       274079111

    TAG:           1.0.1
    STATUS:        Reconcile succeeded
    REASON:
    ```

1. List the available packages by running:

    ```
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    / Retrieving available packages...

## <a id='install-profile'></a> Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile

The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package installs predefined sets of packages based on your profile settings. This is done by using the package manager you installed using Tanzu Cluster Essentials. For more information about profiles, see [Installation profiles in Tanzu Application Platform](overview.md#profiles-and-packages).

To prepare to install a profile:

1. List version information for the package by running:

    ```
    tanzu package available list tap.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Create a `tap-values.yml` file by using the
[Full Profile sample](#full-profile) or [Light Profile sample](#light-profile) as a guide.
These samples have the minimum configuration required to deploy Tanzu Application Platform.
The sample values file contains the necessary defaults for both the meta-package
(parent Tanzu Application Platform package) and subordinate packages
(individual child packages).
The values file you provide during installation is used for further configuration
of Tanzu Application Platform.

    >**Important:** Keep this file for future use.

1. Proceed to the [View possible configuration settings for your package](#view-pkge-config-settings)
section.

Where:

- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `kp_default_repository: "index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `kp_default_repository: "gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME` is the username that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You should be able to `docker push` to this location with this credential.
    * For Google Cloud Registry, use `kp_default_repository_username: _json_key`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD` is the password for the user that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential.
    * For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account JSON key.
- `DESCRIPTOR-NAME` is the name of the descriptor to import automatically. Current available options at time of release:
    * `tap-1.0.0-full` contains all dependencies, and is for production use.
    * `tap-1.0.0-lite` smaller footprint used for speeding up installs. Requires Internet access on the cluster.
- `SERVER-NAME` is the hostname of the registry server. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `server: "my-harbor.io"`
    * Dockerhub has the form `server: "index.docker.io"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `server: "gcr.io"`
- `REPO-NAME` is where workload images are stored in the registry.
Images are written to `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME/workload-name`. Examples:

    * Dockerhub has the form `repository: "my-dockerhub-user"`
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`
- `SSH-SECRET-KEY` is the SSH secret key supported by the specific package.
See [Identify the SSH secret key for your package](#ssh-secret-key) for more information.
- `DOMAIN-NAME` has a value such as `learningcenter.example.com`.
- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's External IP address.
- `GIT-CATALOG-URL` is the path to the `catalog-info.yaml` catalog definition file from either the included Blank catalog (provided as an additional download named "Blank Tanzu Application Platform GUI Catalog") or a Backstage-compliant catalog that you've already built and posted on the Git infrastructure you specified in the Integration section.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you want the `ScanTemplates` to be deployed to. This is the namespace where the scanning feature is going to run.
- `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the secret that contains the credentials to pull an image from the registry for scanning. If built images are pushed to the same registry as the Tanzu Application Platform images, this can reuse the `tap-registry` secret created in step 3 of [Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository](#add-package-repositories).

>**Note:** You can use `buildservice.enable_automatic_dependency_updates: false` in the `tap-values.yaml` to pause the automatic update
>of Build Service dependencies.

tanzu package available get PACKAGE-NAME.tanzu.vmware.com/VERSION --values-schema -n tap-install
```

Where:

- `VERSION` is the version number of the package. For example, `0.5.1` for Supply Chain Basic package.
- `PACKAGE-NAME` is the value of `Top-level Key` for package-specific configuration within
your `tap-values.yml`, as summarized in the following table:  

|Package|Top-level Key|
|----|----|
|API portal|`api_portal`|
|Application Accelerator|`accelerator`|
|Application Live View|`appliveview`|
|Application Live View Conventions|`appliveview-conventions`|
|Cartographer|`cartographer`|
|Cloud Native Runtimes|`cnrs`|
|Supply Chain|`supply_chain`|
|Supply Chain Basic|`ootb_supply_chain_basic`|
|Supply Chain Testing|`ootb_supply_chain_testing`|
|Supply Chain Testing Scanning|`ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning`|

```  

## <a id="install-package"></a>Install your Tanzu Application Platform package

1. Install the package by running:

    ```
    tanzu package install tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v 1.0.1 --values-file tap-values.yml -n tap-install
    ```

1. Verify the package install by running:

    ```
    tanzu package installed get tap -n tap-install
    ```

    This may take 5-10 minutes because it installs several packages on your cluster.

1. Verify that all the necessary packages in the profile are installed by running:

    ```
    tanzu package installed list -A
    ```

1. Ensure you have
[set up developer namespaces to use installed packages](install-components.md#setup).

1. (Optional) [Install any additional packages](install-components.md) that were not included in
your profile.

After you install Full Profile or Light Profile on to your cluster, you can install the
Tanzu Developer Tools for VSCode extension to help you develop against it.
For instructions, see [Installing Tanzu Dev Tools for VSCode](vscode-extension/install.md).

## <a id='configure-envoy-lb'></a> Configure LoadBalancer for Contour ingress

This section only applies when you use Tanzu Application Platform to deploy its own shared Contour ingress controller in `tanzu-system-ingress`. It is not applicable when you use an existing ingress with the components. You can share this ingress across `cnrs`, `tap_gui`, and `learningcenter`.

By default, Contour uses `NodePort` as the service type. To set the service type to `LoadBalancer`, add the following to your `tap-values.yml`:

```
contour:
  envoy:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
```

If you are using AWS, the section above creates a classic LoadBalancer.
If you want to use the Network LoadBalancer instead of the classic LoadBalancer for ingress, add the
following to your `tap-values.yml`:

```
contour:
  infrastructure_provider: aws
  envoy:
    service:
      aws:

## <a id='exclude-packages'></a> Exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile

To exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile:

1. Find the full subordinate (child) package name:

    ```
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Update your `tap-values` file with a section listing the exclusions:

    ```
    profile: PROFILE-VALUE
    excluded_packages:
      - tap-gui.tanzu.vmware.com
      - service-bindings.lab.vmware.com
    ```

>**Note:** If you decide to exclude a package after performing a profile installation which included that package, you cannot see the the accurate package states immediately after running `tap package installed list -n tap-install`.

>**Note:** You can break package dependencies by removing a package. Allow 20 minutes to verify that all packages have reconciled correctly while troubleshooting.
