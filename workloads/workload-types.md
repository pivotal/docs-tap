# Workload types

Tanzu Application Platform allows you to quickly build and test applications regardless of your familiarity with Kubernetes. You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.

A workload allows you to choose application specifications, such as repository location, environment variables, service binding, and so on. For more information about workload creation and management, see [Command Reference](../cli-plugins/apps/command-reference.md).

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workload types, including web applications, serverless functions, or microservices that function as a logical application.
