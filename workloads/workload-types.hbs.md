# Workload types

This topic provides you with an overview of workload types.

## Workload features

Tanzu Application Platform allows you to quickly build and test applications regardless of your familiarity with Kubernetes.

You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.
You can also use supply chains to build applications that process work from a message queue,
or provide arbitrary network services.

A workload allows you to choose application specifications, such as
repository location, environment variables, service binding, and so on.
For more information about workload creation and management, see
[Commands Details](../cli-plugins/apps/reference/reference.hbs.md).

The Out of the Box Supply Chains support a range of workload types,
including scalable web applications (`web`), traditional application
servers (`server`), background applications (`worker`), and serverless
functions.  You can use a collection of workloads of different types
to deploy microservices that function as a logical application, or
deploy your entire application as a single monolith.

If you build your own supply chains, you can define additional
deployment methods beyond those included in the Out of the Box Supply Chain
templates.

## <a id="types"></a> Available Workload types

When using the Out of the Box Supply Chain, the `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type` annotation
selects which style of deployment is suitable for your application. The valid values are:
