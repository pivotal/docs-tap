# FluxCD Source Controller

FluxCD Source Controller provides you with APIs for acquiring resources such as Git, Helm 
repositories and S3 buckets on the cluster.
For more information, see [FluxCD Source Controller documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/). 

The source-controller implements the
[source.toolkit.fluxcd.io](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/tree/main/docs/spec/v1beta1) 
API in GitHub and is a core component of the [GitOps toolkit](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io).
