<!-- This topic must be accessible from https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.5/tap/tap-portal-telemetry.html -->

Tanzu Application Platform GUI uses Pendo.io to better understand the way users interact with our Product in order to provide a better user experience for our customers and to improve VMware products and services and design them better. Pendo.io collects data based on your interaction with the VMware Product, such as clickstream data and page loads, hashed user ID and limited browser and device information. If you would like to opt-out, please follow these instructions.

To enable or disable Pendo telemetry for the organization, please refer to the instruction [Enable or deactivate the Pendo telemetry for the organization](../docs-tap/opting-out-telemetry.hbs.md#enable-or-deactivate-the-pendo-telemetry-for-the-organization).
