# Configuring Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy

This topic describes how you can configure Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy.
SCST - Policy requires extra configuration steps to verify your container
images.

## <a id="admission-of-images"></a> Admission of Images

An image is admitted after it is validated against a policy with
matching image pattern, and where at least one valid signature is obtained from
the authorities provided in a matched [ClusterImagePolicy](#create-cip-resource).

If more than one policy exists with a matching image pattern, _ALL_ of the policies
must have at least one passing authority for the image.

## <a id="including-namespaces"></a> Including Namespaces

The Policy Controller only validates resources in namespaces
that have chosen to opt-in. This is done by adding the label
`policy.sigstore.dev/include: "true"` to the namespace resource.

```console
kubectl label namespace my-secure-namespace policy.sigstore.dev/include=true
```

> **Caution** Without a Policy Controller ClusterImagePolicy applied, there are
fallback behaviors where images are validated against the public Sigstore
Rekor and Fulcio servers by using a keyless authority flow. Therefore, if the
deploying image is signed publicly by a third-party using the keyless
authority flow, the image is admitted as it can validate against the public
Rekor and Fulcio. To avoid this behavior, develop, and apply a ClusterImagePolicy
that applies to the images being deployed in the namespace.

## <a id="create-cip-resource"></a> Create a `ClusterImagePolicy` resource

The cluster image policy is a custom resource containing the following properties:

### <a id="cip-images"></a> `images`

In a ClusterImagePolicy, `spec.images` specifies a list of glob matching patterns.
These patterns are matched against the image digest in `PodSpec` for resources
attempting deployment.

Policy Controller defines the following globs by default:

- If `*` is specified, the `glob` matching behavior is `index.docker.io/library/*`.
- If `*/*` is specified, the `glob` matching behavior is `index.docker.io/*/*`.

With these defaults, you require the `glob` pattern `**` to match against all images.
If your image is hosted on Docker Hub, include `index.docker.io` as the host for the glob.

A sample ClusterImagePolicy which matches against all images using glob:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "**"
```

### <a id="cip-mode"></a> `mode`

In a ClusterImagePolicy, `spec.mode` specifies the action of a policy:

- `enforce`: The default behavior. If the policy fails to validate the image, the policy fails.
- `warn`: If the policy fails to validate the image, validation error messages are converted to warnings and the policy passes.

A sample of a ClusterImagePolicy which has `warn` mode configured.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: POLICY-NAME
spec:
  mode: warn
```

Where `POLICY-NAME` is the name of the policy you want to configure your ClusterImagePolicy with.

When `enforce` mode is set, an image that fails validation is not admitted.

Sample output message:

```console
error: failed to patch: admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[0].image
IMAGE-REFERENCE signature key validation failed for authority authority-0 for IMAGE-REFERENCE: GET IMAGE-SIGNATURE-REFERENCE: DENIED: denied; denied
failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[1].image
IMAGE-REFERENCE signature key validation failed for authority authority-0 for IMAGE-REFERENCE: GET IMAGE-SIGNATURE-REFERENCE: DENIED: denied; denied
```

When `warn` mode is set, an image that fails validation is admitted.

Sample output message:

```console
Warning: failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[0].image
Warning: IMAGE-REFERENCE signature key validation failed for authority authority-0 for IMAGE-REFERENCE: GET IMAGE-SIGNATURE-REFERENCE: DENIED: denied; denied
Warning: failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[1].image
Warning: IMAGE-REFERENCE signature key validation failed for authority authority-0 for IMAGE-REFERENCE: GET IMAGE-SIGNATURE-REFERENCE: DENIED: denied; denied
```

If you don't want a `Warning` output message, you can configure a
`static.action` `pass` authority to allow expected unsigned images. For example,
you may want to allow unsigned images if your policy controller runs on a
development environment, and you need to iterate quickly. For information about
static action authorities, see [Static Action](#cip-static-action).

### <a id="cip-match"></a> `match`

You can use `match` to filter resources using group, version, kind, or labels in a
selected namespace to enforce the defined policy.
If the list of matching resources is empty, all core resources are used by default.

For example, you can filter all `v1 cronjobs` with the label `app: tap` in a namespace that
is labeled for policy enforcement:

```yaml
spec:
  match:
  - group: batch
    resource: cronjobs
    version: v1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: tap
```

### <a id="cip-authorities"></a> `authorities`

Authorities listed in the `authorities` block of the ClusterImagePolicy are
`key` or `keyless` specifications.

#### <a id="key-authority"></a> `key`

Each `key` authority can contain a PEM-encoded ECDSA public key, a `secretRef`,
or a `kms` path.

The policy resyncs with KMS referenced every 10 hours. Any updates to the secret
in KMS is pulled in during the refresh. To force a resync, the policy must be
deleted and recreated.

> **Important** Only ECDSA public keys are supported.

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - key:
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    - key:
        secretRef:
          name: secretName
    - key:
        kms: KMSPATH
```

Where `KMSPATH` is the name of the KMS path you want to configure in your key authority.

> **Note** The secret referenced in `key.secretRef.name` must be created
in the `cosign-system` namespace or the namespace where the Policy Controller
is installed. This secret must only contain one `data` entry with the public key.

#### <a id="keyless-authority"></a> `keyless`

> **Note** Keyless support is deactivated by default. See [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller](./install-scst-policy.hbs.md).

Each keyless authority can contain a Fulcio URL, a Rekor URL, a certificate, or
an array of identities.

Identities are represented with a combination of `issuer` or `issuerRegExp` with `subject` or `subjectRegExp`.

- `issuer`: Defines the issuer for this identity.
- `issuerRegExp`: Specifies a regular expression to match the issuer for this identity.
- `subject`: Defines the subject for this identity.
- `subjectRegExp`: Specifies a regular expression to match the subject for this identity.

An example of keyless authority structure:

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
        ca-cert:
          data: Certificate Data
        identities:
          - issuer: https://accounts.google.com
            subjectRegExp: .*@example.com 
          - issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            subject: https://github.com/mycompany/*/.github/workflows/*@*
      ctlog:
        url: https://rekor.example.com
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
        ca-cert:
          secretRef:
            name: secretName
        identities:
          - issuerRegExp: .*kubernetes.default.*
            subjectRegExp: .*kubernetes.io/namespaces/default/serviceaccounts/default
```

The authorities are evaluated using the `any of` operator to admit container
images. For each pod, the Policy Controller iterates over the list of containers
and init containers. For every policy that matches against the images, they must
each have at least one valid signature obtained using the authorities specified.
If an image does not match any policy, the Policy Controller
does not admit the image.

#### <a id="cip-static-action"></a> `static.action`

ClusterImagePolicy authorities are configured to always `pass` or `fail` with `static.action`.

Sample `ClusterImagePolicy` with static action `fail`.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: POLICY-NAME
spec:
  authorities:
  - static:
      action: fail
```

Where `POLICY-NAME` is the name of the policy you want to configure your ClusterImagePolicy with.

A sample output of static action `fail`:

```console
error: failed to patch: admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[0].image
IMAGE-REFERENCE disallowed by static policy
failed policy: POLICY-NAME: spec.template.spec.containers[1].image
IMAGE-REFERENCE disallowed by static policy
```

Images that are unsigned in a namespace with validation enabled are admitted
with an authority with static action `pass`.

This applies when you are configuring a policy with `static.action`
`pass` for `tap-packages` images. Another policy is then configured to validate
signed images produced by Tanzu Build Service. This allows images from
`tap-packages`, which are unsigned and required by the platform, to be admitted
while still validating signed built images from Tanzu Build Service. See
[Configure your supply chain to sign and verify your image
builds](../getting-started/config-supply-chain.md#config-sc-to-img-builds).

If `Warning` messages are desirable for admitted images where validation failed,
you can configure a policy with `warn` mode and valid authorities.
For information about ClusterImagePolicy modes, see [Mode](#cip-mode).

## <a id='provide-creds-for-package'></a> Provide credentials for the package

There are three ways the package reads credentials to authenticate to registries
protected by authentication:

1. Reading `imagePullSecrets` directly from the resource being admitted. See [Container image pull secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-imagepullsecrets) in the Kubernetes documentation.

1. Reading `imagePullSecrets` from the service account the resource is running as. See [Arranging for imagePullSecrets to be automatically attached](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#arranging-for-imagepullsecrets-to-be-automatically-attached) in the Kubernetes documentation.

1. Reading a `secretRef` from the `ClusterImagePolicy` resource's
`signaturePullSecrets` when specifying the cosign signature source.

Authentication can fail for the following scenarios:

- A not valid credential is specified in the `imagePullSecrets` of the resource
  or in the service account the resource runs as.
- A not valid credential is specified in the `ClusterImagePolicy` `signaturePullSecrets` text box.

### <a id="provide-pol-auth-secrets"></a> Provide secrets for authentication in your policy

You can provide secrets for authentication as part of the policy
configuration. The `oci` location is the image location or a remote location
where signatures are configured to be stored during signing.
The `signaturePullSecrets` is available in the `cosign-system` namespace
or the namespace where the Policy Controller is installed.

By default, `imagePullSecrets` from the resource or service account is used
while the default `oci` location is the image location.

See the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - key:
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
          signaturePullSecrets:
            - name: MY-SECRET
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
          signaturePullSecrets:
            - name: MY-SECRET
```

Where `MY-SECRET` is the name of the secret you want to use with your credentials.

VMware recommends using a set of credentials with the least amount of
privilege that allows reading the signature stored in your registry.

## <a id="verify-configuration"></a> Verify your configuration

A sample policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign*"
  authorities:
  - name: official-cosign-key
    key:
      data: |
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEhyQCx0E9wQWSFI9ULGwy3BuRklnt
        IqozONbbdbqz11hlRJy9c7SG+hdcFl9jE9uE/dwtuwU2MqU9T/cN0YkWww==
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

When using the sample policy, run these commands to verify your configuration:

1. Verify that the Policy Controller admits the signed image that validates
with the configured public key. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl run cosign \
      --image=gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v1.2.1 \
      --dry-run=server
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ kubectl run cosign \
      --image=gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v1.2.1 \
      --dry-run=server
    pod/cosign created (server dry run)
    ```

    If you are using TKGs or Openshift, you will need to add some overrides:
    ```
    $ kubectl run cosign \
      --image=gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v1.2.1 \
      --overrides='{"spec": {"securityContext": {"seccompProfile": {"type": "RuntimeDefault"}}, "containers": [{"name": "cosign", "securityContext": {"allowPrivilegeEscalation": false, "runAsNonRoot": true, "capabilities": {"drop": ["ALL"]}}}]}}' \
      --override-type strategic \
      --dry-run=server
    pod/cosign created (server dry run)
    ```

1. Verify that the Policy Controller rejects the unmatched image. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --dry-run=server
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --dry-run=server
      Error from server (BadRequest): admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: no matching policies: spec.containers[0].image
      index.docker.io/library/busybox@sha256:3614ca5eacf0a3a1bcc361c939202a974b4902b9334ff36eb29ffe9011aaad83
    ```

    In the output, it did not specify which authorities were used as there was
    no policy found that matched the image.
    Therefore, the image fails to validate for a signature and fails to deploy.

1. Verify that the Policy Controller rejects a matched image signed with a
different key than the one configured. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl run cosign-fail \
      --image=gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v0.3.0 \
      --dry-run=server
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ kubectl run cosign-fail \
        --image=gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v0.3.0 \
        --dry-run=server
      Error from server (BadRequest): admission webhook "policy.sigstore.dev" denied the request: validation failed: failed policy: image-policy: spec.containers[0].image
      gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign@sha256:135d8c5e27bdc917f04b415fc947d7d5b1137f99bb8fa00bffc3eca1856e9c52 failed to validate public keys with authority official-cosign-key for gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign@sha256:135d8c5e27bdc917f04b415fc947d7d5b1137f99bb8fa00bffc3eca1856e9c52: no matching signatures:
    ```

    In the output, it specifies which authorities were used for validation when
    a policy was found that matched the image. In this case, the authority used
    was `official-cosign-key`. If no name is specified, it is defaulted to
    `authority-#`.
