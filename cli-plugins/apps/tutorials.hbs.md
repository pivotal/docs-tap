### <a id='prereqs'></a>Installation prerequisites

Before you install the Apps CLI plug-in:

- Follow the instructions to [Install or update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](../../install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md#cli-and-plugin).

### <a id='install'></a>Install

#### <a id='from-tap-net'></a>From Tanzu Network

To install the Apps CLI plug-in:

1. From the `$HOME/tanzu` directory, run:

    ```console
    tanzu plugin install --local ./cli apps
    ```

2. To verify that the CLI is installed correctly, run:

    ```console
    tanzu apps version
    ```

    A version should be displayed in the output.

    If the following error is displayed during installation:

    ```console
    Error: could not find plug-in "apps" in any known repositories

    âœ–  could not find plug-in "apps" in any known repositories
    ```

    Verify that there is an `apps` entry in the `cli/manifest.yaml` file. It should look like this:

    ```yaml
    plugins:
    ...
        - name: apps
        description: Applications on Kubernetes
        versions: []
    ```

#### <a id='from-release'></a>From Release

The latest release can be found in the [repository releases page](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/apps-cli-plugin/releases/). Each of these releases has the *Assets* section where the packages for each *system-architecture* are placed.

To install the Apps CLI plug-in:

Download binary executable `tanzu-apps-plugin-{OS_ARCH}-{version}.tar.gz`
Run the following commands(for example for macOS and plugin version v0.10.0)

```bash
tar -xvf tanzu-apps-plugin-darwin-amd64-v0.10.0.tar.gz
tanzu plugin install apps --local ./tanzu-apps-plugin-darwin-amd64-v0.10.0 --version v0.10.0
```

### <a id='uninstall'>Uninstalling Apps CLI plug-in

To uninstall Apps CLI plug-in by using:

```bash
tanzu plugin delete apps
```

## <a id='changing-clusters'></a> Changing clusters

The Apps CLI plug-in refers to the default kubeconfig file to access a Kubernetes cluster.
When a `tanzu apps` command is run, the plug-in uses the default context that's defined in that kubeconfig file (located by default at `$HOME/.kube/config`).

There are two ways to change the target cluster:

1. Use `kubectl config use-context <context-name>` to change the default context. All subsequent `tanzu apps` commands will target the cluster defined in the new default kubeconfig context.
2. Include the `--context <context-name>` flag when running any `tanzu apps` command. All subsequent `tanzu apps` commands without the `--context <context-name>` flag will continue to use the default context set in the kubeconfig.

There are also two ways to override the default kubeconfig:

3. Set the env var `KUBECONFIG=<path>` to change the kubeconfig the Apps CLI plug-in should reference. All subsequent `tanzu apps` commands will reference the non-default kubeconfig assigned to the env var.
4. Include the  `--kubeconfig <path>` flag when running any `tanzu apps` command. All subsequent `tanzu apps` commands without the `--kubeconfig <path>` flag will continue to use the default kubeconfig.

For more information about kubeconfig, see [Configure Access to Multiple Clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/).

## <a id='autocompletion'></a> Autocompletion

To enable command autocompletion, the Tanzu CLI offers the `tanzu completion` command.

Add the following command to the shell config file according to the current setup. Use one of the following options:

### <a id='bash'></a> Bash

```bash
tanzu completion bash >  $HOME/.tanzu/completion.bash.inc
```

### <a id='zsh'></a> Zsh

```bash
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
tanzu completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_tanzu"
```

## <a id='about-workloads'> About workloads

### <a id='creating-workloads'> Creating workloads

There are various ways to create workloads. These are:

- Using URL to git repo. Source code can be read from either git branch, git tag or git commit.
- Creating from an existing local project as source. 
- Using an image that will be pulled from a registry to deploy the application.
- Setting a Maven repository artifact.

Some examples of each of these ways are given in the [workload creation](create-workload.hbs.md) page.

### <a id='debugging-workloads'> Debugging and troubleshooting workloads

Workload status can be checked with commands as `tanzu apps workload get` and `tanzu apps workload tail`.

`workload get` is used to see the workload specification and the resources attached to it, while `workload tail` is used to see build and runtime logs.

More info on the usage of these commands and common errors, can be found on [debugging workloads](debug-workload.hbs.md) page.
