# Apps CLI plug-in overview

This Tanzu CLI plug-in provides the ability to create, view, update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application Platform components installed.

## <a id='about'></a>About workloads

Tanzu Application Platform enables developers to quickly build and test applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes.
Developers can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.

A workload enables developers to choose application specifications, such as repository location, environment variables, service binding, and more.

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workloads, including a serverless process that starts on demand, a constellation of microservices that functions as a logical application, or a small hello-world test app.
