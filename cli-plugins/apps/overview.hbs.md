# Apps CLI plug-in overview

Use the Apps CLI plug-in to create, view, update, and delete application workloads on a Kubernetes
cluster that has Tanzu Application Platform installed.

## <a id='about'></a>About workloads

Tanzu Application Platform enables you to quickly build and test applications regardless of
your familiarity with Kubernetes. You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container
with a URL. A workload enables you to choose application specifications, such as repository location,
environment variables, and service binding.

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workloads, including a serverless process that
starts on demand, a constellation of microservices that functions as a logical application, or
a small hello-world test application.
