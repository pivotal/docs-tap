# tanzu apps workload delete

This command deletes workloads in a cluster. Deleting a workload does not mean the images published in the registry are deleted with it.

## Default view

When attempting to delete a workload, if not used with `--yes` flag, a message asking if the workload is really to be deleted is shown in the terminal and, if user answers `Y`, and then the workload starts a deletion process inside the cluster.

```bash
tanzu apps workload delete spring-pet-clinic
❓ Really delete the workload "spring-pet-clinic"? Yes
👍 Deleted workload "spring-pet-clinic"

```bash
tanzu apps workload delete spring-pet-clinic --yes
