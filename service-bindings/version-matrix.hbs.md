# Version matrix for Service Bindings

This topic gives you a matrix of versions between Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP),
the package (`servicebinding.tanzu.vmware.com`), and
[Service Binding Runtime](https://github.com/servicebinding/runtime/).

[Service Binding Runtime](https://github.com/servicebinding/runtime/) is the community reference
implementation of [Service Binding](https://servicebinding.io/).

> is a change to one or more of the other versions in the table. Otherwise, the corresponding
> versions remain the same for each Tanzu Application Platform patch release.
