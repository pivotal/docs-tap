# About Bitnami Services

Bitnami Services provides an pre-installed set of backing services for Tanzu Application Platform.
The services consist of MySQL, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and Redis, all of which are backed by the
corresponding Bitnami Helm Chart.
Through integration with [Crossplane](../crossplane/about.hbs.md) and
[Services Toolkit](../services-toolkit/about.hbs.md), these four services are immediately ready
for apps teams to consume, with no additional setup or configuration required from ops teams.
This makes it incredibly quick and easy to get started working with services on Tanzu Application Platform.
