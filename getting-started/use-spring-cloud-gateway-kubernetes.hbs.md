# Use Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

This topic describes how to use Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes as an API gateway for
workloads running on Tanzu Application Platform.

## <a id="spring-cloud-gateway"></a> Using Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Gateway is a popular project library for creating an API Gateway that is built on top of
the Spring ecosystem.

The open source library is a foundational component of VMware Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes and
Spring Cloud Gateway for VMware Tanzu Application Service commercial offerings
with commercial-only capabilities and platform-integrated operator experiences.
You can use the open source and commercial offerings as a reverse proxy with additional API Gateway
functions to handle request and response to upstream application services.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes is included with Tanzu Application Platform v1.5 and later.

This topic helps you to migrate upstream applications that expose API routes on Spring Cloud Gateway
from Tanzu Application Service and custom open source implementations to Tanzu Application Platform.
