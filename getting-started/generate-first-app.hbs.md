# Generate an application with Application Accelerator

This topic guides you through how to generate a new project using Application Accelerator
and how to deploy the project onto a Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) cluster.
For background information, see [Application Accelerator](about-application-accelerator.md).

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before you start, complete all [Getting Started prerequisites](../getting-started.md#get-started-prereqs).

## <a id="interface-options"></a> Generate a project using an Application Accelerator

There are multiple interfaces that you can use to generate a new project. The options are:

- Application Accelerator extension for VS Code
- Application Accelerator plug-in for IntelliJ
- Tanzu Developer Portal (formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI)

Choose one of the following tabs for how to generate and deploy applications using your selected interface.
If you have already generated a project and want to skip this step, you can go to
[Deploying your application with Tanzu Application Platform](deploy-first-app.hbs.md).

VS Code
: **What you will do:**

  - Install the Application Accelerator extension for VS Code.
  - (Optional) Provision a new GitHub repository and upload the project to the
    repository.
  - Generate a project using an Application Accelerator.
