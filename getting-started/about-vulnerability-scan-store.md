# Vulnerability scanning and metadata storage for your supply chain

This feature set allows an application operator to introduce source code and image vulnerability scanning, and scan-time rules, to their Tanzu Application Platform supply chain. The scan-time rules prevent critical vulnerabilities from flowing to the supply chain unresolved.

[Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](../scst-store/overview.md) takes the vulnerability scanning results and stores them. Users can query for information about CVEs, images, packages, and their relationships by using the `tanzu insight` CLI plug-in, or directly from the API.

## <a id="features"></a>Features

  - Scan source code repositories and images for known CVEs before deploying to a cluster.
  - Identify CVEs by scanning continuously on each new code commit or each new image built.
  - Analyze scan results against user-defined policies using Open Policy Agent.
  - Produce vulnerability scan results and post them to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store where they can be queried.
  - Query the store for such use cases as:
    - What images and packages are affected by a specific vulnerability?
    - What source code repos are affected by a specific vulnerability?
    - What packages and vulnerabilities does a particular image have?
