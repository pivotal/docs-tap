# Supply chains on Tanzu Application Platform

This topic describes the key concepts you need to know about supply chains and
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) on Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

Supply chains provide a way of codifying all of the steps of your path to production, more commonly
known as CI/CD.
CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver applications by introducing automation into the stages of
application development.
The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous
deployment.

CI/CD is the method used by supply chains to deliver applications through automation.
Tanzu Application Platform supply chains allow you to use CI/CD and add any other steps necessary for
an application to reach production or a different environment, such as staging.

## <a id="path-to-prod"></a>A path to production

A path to production allows users to create a unified access point for all of the tools required
for their applications to reach a customer-facing environment.
Instead of having four tools that are loosely coupled to each other, a path to production defines
all four tools in a single, unified layer of abstraction. The path to production can be automated and
repeatable between teams for applications at scale.

Typically tools cannot integrate with one another without scripting or webhooks.
Whereas with a path to production, there is a unified automation tool to codify all the interactions
between each of the tools.
Supply chains that are used to codify the path to production for an organization are configurable.
This allows their authors to add all of the steps of the path to production for their applications.

## <a id="avail-supply-chains"></a>Available Supply Chains

The Tanzu Application Platform provides three out of the box (OOTB) supply chains to
work with the Tanzu Application Platform components. They include:

-  OOTB Supply Chain Basic (default)
-  OOTB Supply Chain with Testing (optional)
-  OOTB Supply Chain with Testing+Scanning (optional)

## <a id="OOTB-basic-sc-default"></a>1: **OOTB Basic (default)**

The default **OOTB Basic** supply chain and its dependencies were installed on your cluster during the Tanzu Application Platform install.
The following table and diagrams provide descriptions for each of the supply chains and dependencies provided with the Tanzu Application Platform.

   <td>This supply chain monitors a repository that is identified in the developerâ€™s `workload.yaml` file. When any new commits are made to the application, the supply chain:
<ul>

<li>Creates a new image.

<li>Applies any predefined conventions.

## <a id="OOTB-testing"></a>2: **OOTB Testing**

**OOTB Testing** supply chain runs a Tekton pipeline within the supply chain.

## <a id="OOTB-test-and-scan"></a>3: **OOTB Testing+Scanning**

**OOTB Testing+Scanning** supply chain includes integrations for secure scanning tools.
