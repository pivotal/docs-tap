# Add testing and security scanning to your application

This how-to guide walks you through installing the optional OOTB Supply Chain with Testing and the optional OOTB Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning.

For more information on available supply chains, see [Supply chains on Tanzu Application Platform](about-supply-chains.md).

## <a id="you-will"></a>What you will do

- Install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing
- Add a Tekton pipeline to the cluster and update the workload to point to the pipeline and resolve errors.
- Install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning
- Update the workload to point to the Tekton pipeline and resolve errors.
- Query for vulnerabilities and dependencies.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The default Out of the Box (OOTB) Supply Chain Basic and its dependencies were installed on your cluster during the Tanzu Application Platform install. You also have the option to add testing and security scanning to your application.

The following installations also provide a sample Tekton pipeline that tests your sample application.  The pipeline is configurable. Therefore, you can customize the steps to perform
either additional testing or other tasks with Tekton Pipelines.

>**Important:** You can only have one Tekton pipeline per namespace. 

## <a id="install-OOTB-test"></a>Install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing 

To install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing, follow these steps:

1. You can activate the OOTB Supply Chain with Testing by updating our profile to use `testing` rather than `basic` as the selected supply chain for workloads in this cluster.
Update `tap-values.yaml` (the file used to customize the profile in `Tanzu package install tap
--values-file=...`) with the following changes:

    ```yaml
    - supply_chain: basic
    + supply_chain: testing

    - ootb_supply_chain_basic:
    + ootb_supply_chain_testing:
        registry:
          server: "<SERVER-NAME>"
          repository: "<REPO-NAME>"
    ```

2. Update the installed profile by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v VERSION-NUMBER --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

    Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

### <a id="tekton-config-example"></a>Tekton pipeline config example

In this section, a Tekton pipeline is added to the cluster. In the next section,
the workload is updated to point to the pipeline and resolve any current errors.

>**Note:** Developers can perform this step because they know how their application needs to be tested.
The operator can also add the Tekton supply chain to a cluster before the developer get access.

To add the Tekton supply chain to the cluster, apply the following YAML to the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: developer-defined-tekton-pipeline
  labels:
    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/pipeline: test     # (!) required
spec:
  params:
    - name: source-url                       # (!) required
    - name: source-revision                  # (!) required
  tasks:
    - name: test
      params:
        - name: source-url
          value: $(params.source-url)
        - name: source-revision
          value: $(params.source-revision)
      taskSpec:
        params:
          - name: source-url
          - name: source-revision
        steps:
          - name: test
            image: gradle
            script: |-
              cd `mktemp -d`

              wget -qO- $(params.source-url) | tar xvz -m
              ./mvnw test
```

The preceding YAML defines a Tekton Pipeline with a single step.
The step itself contained in the `steps` pull the code from the repository indicated
in the developers `workload` and run the tests within the repository.
The steps of the Tekton pipeline are configurable and allow the developer to add any additional items
that is needed to test their code.
Because this step is one of many in the supply chain (and the next step is an image build in this case),
the developer is free to focus on testing their code.
Any additional steps that the developer adds to the Tekton pipeline is independent
for the image being built and any subsequent steps of the supply chain being executed.

The `params` are templated by the Supply Chain Choreographer.
Additionally, Tekton pipelines require a Tekton `pipelineRun` in order to execute on the cluster.
The Supply Chain Choreographer handles creating the `pipelineRun` dynamically each time
that step of the supply requires execution.

### <a id="test-workload-update"></a>Workload update

To connect the new supply chain to the workload,
the workload must be updated to point at your Tekton pipeline.

1. Update the workload by running the following with the Tanzu CLI:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
      --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app \
      --git-branch main \
      --type web \
      --label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests=true \
      --yes
    ```

    ```console
    Create workload:
        1 + |---
        2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
        3 + |kind: Workload
        4 + |metadata:
        5 + |  labels:
        6 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests: "true"
        7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
        8 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
        9 + |  namespace: default
       10 + |spec:
       11 + |  source:
       12 + |    git:
       13 + |      ref:
       14 + |        branch: main
       15 + |      url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app

    ? Do you want to create this workload? Yes
    Created workload "tanzu-java-web-app"
    ```

2. After accepting the workload creation, monitor the creation of new resources by the workload by running:

    ```console
    kubectl get workload,gitrepository,pipelinerun,images.kpack,podintent,app,services.serving
    ```

  You will see output similar to the following example that shows the objects that were created by the Supply Chain Choreographer:

    ```console

    ```

## <a id="install-OOTB-test-scan"></a>Install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning

To install OOTB Supply Chain with Testing and Scanning, follow these steps:

  > **Note:** When leveraging both Tanzu Build Service and Grype in your Tanzu Application Platform supply chain, you can receive enhanced scanning coverage for Java and Node.js workloads that includes application runtime layer dependencies.

>**Important:** The grype must be installed for scanning.

1. Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan is installed as part of the profiles.
Verify that both Scan Link and Grype Scanner are installed by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed get scanning -n tap-install
    tanzu package installed get grype -n tap-install
    ```

    If the packages are not already installed, follow the steps in [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/install-scst-scan.md) to install the required scanning components.

    During installation of the Grype Scanner, sample ScanTemplates are installed into the `default` namespace. If the workload is deployed into another namespace, these sample ScanTemplates must also be present in the other namespace. One way to accomplish this is to install Grype Scanner again and provide the namespace in the values file.

    A ScanPolicy is required and the following code must be in the required namespace. You can either add the namespace flag to the kubectl  command or add the namespace field to the template itself. Run:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f - -o yaml << EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ScanPolicy
    metadata:
      name: scan-policy
    spec:
      regoFile: |
        package main

        # Accepted Values: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Negligible", "UnknownSeverity"
        notAllowedSeverities := ["Critical","High","UnknownSeverity"]
        ignoreCves := []

        contains(array, elem) = true {
          array[_] = elem
        } else = false { true }

        isSafe(match) {
          fails := contains(notAllowedSeverities, match.ratings.rating[_])
          not fails
        }

        isSafe(match) {
          ignore := contains(ignoreCves, match.Id)
          ignore
        }

        deny[msg] {
          comp := input.bom.components.component[_]
          vuln := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability[_]
          ratings := vuln.ratings.rating[_]
          not isSafe(vuln)
          msg = sprintf("CVE %s %s %s", [comp.name, vuln.id, ratings])
        }
    EOF
    ```

2. (optional) To persist and query the vulnerability results post-scan, ensure that [Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](../scst-store/overview.md) is installed using the following command. The Tanzu Application Platform profiles install the package by default.

    ```console
    tanzu package installed get metadata-store -n tap-install
    ```

    If the package is not installed, follow [the installation instructions](../scst-store/install-scst-store.md).


3. Update the profile to use the supply chain with testing and scanning by
   updating `tap-values.yaml` (the file used to customize the profile in `tanzu
   package install tap --values-file=...`) with the following changes:


    ```console
    - supply_chain: testing
    + supply_chain: testing_scanning

    - ootb_supply_chain_testing:
    + ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning:
        registry:
          server: "<SERVER-NAME>"
          repository: "<REPO-NAME>"
    ```

4. Update the `tap` package:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v VERSION-NUMBER --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

    Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

### <a id="test-scan-workload-update"></a>Workload update

To connect the new supply chain to the workload, update the workload to point to your Tekton
pipeline:

1. Update the workload by running the following using the Tanzu CLI:

    ```console
    tanzu apps workload create tanzu-java-web-app \
      --git-repo https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app \
      --git-branch main \
      --type web \
      --label apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests=true \
      --yes
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    Create workload:
          1 + |---
          2 + |apiVersion: carto.run/v1alpha1
          3 + |kind: Workload
          4 + |metadata:
          5 + |  labels:
          6 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/has-tests: "true"
          7 + |    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type: web
          8 + |  name: tanzu-java-web-app
          9 + |  namespace: default
        10 + |spec:
        11 + |  source:
        12 + |    git:
        13 + |      ref:
        14 + |        branch: main
        15 + |      url: https://github.com/sample-accelerators/tanzu-java-web-app

    ? Do you want to create this workload? Yes
    Created workload "tanzu-java-web-app"
    ```

1. After accepting the workload creation, view the new resources that the workload created by running:

    ```console
    kubectl get workload,gitrepository,sourcescan,pipelinerun,images.kpack,imagescan,podintent,app,services.serving
    ```

    The following is an example output, which shows the objects that the Supply Chain Choreographer created:

    ```console

    ```

    If the source or image scan has a "Failed" phase, then the scan has failed compliance and the supply chain stops.

### <a id="query-for-vuln"></a> Query for vulnerabilities

Scan reports are automatically saved to the [Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](../scst-store/overview.md), and can be queried for vulnerabilities and dependencies. For example, open-source software (OSS) or third-party packages.

1. Query the tanzu-java-web-app image dependencies and vulnerabilities with the following commands:

  ```console
    insight image get --digest DIGEST
    insight image vulnerabilities --digest  DIGEST
  ```

  `DIGEST` is the component version, or image digest printed in the `KUBECTL GET` command.

  > **Important:** The `Insight CLI` is separate from the Tanzu CLI.

See [Tanzu Insight plug-in overview](../cli-plugins/insight/cli-overview.md)
additional information and examples.
