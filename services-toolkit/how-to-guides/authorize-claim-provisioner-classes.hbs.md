# Authorize users and groups to claim from provisioner-based classes

This Services Toolkit topic for [service operators](../reference/terminology-and-user-roles.hbs.md#so)
explains how you configure access control so that the required users and groups have authorization to
claim from provisioner-based classes.

By default, only users with `cluster-admin` privileges are authorized to create claims for
provisioner-based classes.
This is because creating claims for provisioner-based classes creates new service instances,
all of which consume resources and might incur monetary cost.
As such, you might want to configure some form of access control.

There is one exception to this rule, which is that by default, users with the `app-operator`
user role are authorized to create claims for the provisioner-based classes that are part of the
[Bitnami Services](../../bitnami-services/about.hbs.md) package.
For how-to deactivate this default behavior, see
[Revoke default authorization for claiming from the Bitnami Services classes](#bitnami-services)
later in this topic.

Access control is implemented through standard Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with
the use of the custom verb `claim`.
You must create a rule in a `ClusterRole` which specifies the `claim` verb for one or
more `clusterinstanceclasses`, and then bind the `ClusterRole` to the roles that you want to
authorize to create claims for the classes.
This approach is particularly effective when paired with Tanzu Application Platform's aggregated user roles.
For more information about user roles in Tanzu Application Platform, see
[Role descriptions](../../authn-authz/role-descriptions.html).

## <a id="auth-all-users"></a> Authorize all users with the app-operator user role to claim from any namespace

Create a `ClusterRole` with a rule that specifies the `claim` verb for one or more `ClusterInstanceClass`
resources and apply the relevant label.

For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: app-operator-claim-class-bigcorp-rabbitmq
  labels:
    apps.tanzu.vmware.com/aggregate-to-app-operator-cluster-access: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com
  resources:
  - clusterinstanceclasses
  resourceNames:
  - bigcorp-rabbitmq
  verbs:
  - claim
```

This example specifies a `ClusterRole` that permits claiming from a class named `bigcorp-rabbitmq`.
The example also includes the `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/aggregate-to-app-operator-cluster-access: "true"` label,
which causes this `ClusterRole` to aggregate to Tanzu Application Platform's [app-operator](../../authn-authz/role-descriptions.html#app-operator)
user role at the cluster scope.

The result is that any user who has the `app-operator` role is now authorized to create claims
for the `bigcorp-rabbitmq` class in any namespace on the cluster.

## <a id="auth-one-user"></a> Authorize a user to claim from a specific namespace

Create a `ClusterRole` with a rule that specifies the `claim` verb for one or more `ClusterInstanceClass`
resource and a corresponding `RoleBinding` to bind it to a user.

For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: claim-class-bigcorp-rabbitmq
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - services.apps.tanzu.vmware.com
  resources:
  - clusterinstanceclasses
  resourceNames:
  - bigcorp-rabbitmq
  verbs:
  - claim

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: alice-claim-class-bigcorp-rabbitmq
  namespace: dev-team-1
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: claim-class-bigcorp-rabbitmq
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "alice@example.com"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

This example specifies a `ClusterRole` that permits claiming from a class named `bigcorp-rabbitmq`.
The YAML also creates a `RoleBinding` in the `dev-team-1` namespace that binds the user
`alice@example.com` to the `ClusterRole`.

The result is that `alice@example.com` is now authorized to create claims for the
`bigcorp-rabbitmq` class in the `dev-team-1` namespace on the cluster.

## <a id="bitnami-services"></a> Revoke default authorization for claiming from the Bitnami Services classes

By default, users with the `app-operator` user role are authorized to create claims for the
provisioner-based classes which are part of the [Bitnami Services](../../bitnami-services/about.hbs.md) package.

To revoke this authorization:

1. Add the following to your `tap-values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    bitnami_services:
      globals:
        create_clusterroles: false
    ```

1. Update Tanzu Application Platform by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

The result is that any user who has the `app-operator` role is now not authorized to create claims
for any of the Bitnami services in any namespace on the cluster.
