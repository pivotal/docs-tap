# Services Toolkit

Services Toolkit is responsible for backing many of the most powerful service capabilities in
Tanzu Application Platform.

From the integration of an extensive list of cloud-based and on-prem services, through to the offering
and discovery of those services, and finally to the claiming and binding of service instances to
application workloads, Services Toolkit has the tools you need to make working with services on
Tanzu Application Platform simple, easy, and effective.

## <a id="capabilities"></a> Capabilities

The main capabilities on offer in Tanzu Application Platform through Services Toolkit are:

1. The classes and claims abstraction: provides a simple, but powerful, user experience to apps teams,
while promoting a strong separation of concerns between apps teams and ops teams.

1. Dynamic provisioning of service instances: enables apps teams to create service
instances that adhere to company policy. Apps teams can create instances on-demand as needed.

1. Seamless integration of almost any service, cloud-based or on-prem, into Tanzu Application Platform
with minimal configuration overhead: provides a near-limitless range of services to help boost
developer productivity.
