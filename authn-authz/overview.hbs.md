# Tanzu Application Platform authentication and authorization overview

Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP) v{{ vars.url_version }} includes:

- Six default roles to help you set up permissions for users and [service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) within a namespace on a cluster that runs one of the Tanzu Application Platform profiles.
- A Tanzu CLI RBAC (role-based access control) plug-in for role binding. For more information, see [Bind a user or group to a default role](binding.md).
- Documentation for [integrating with your existing identity management solution](integrating-identity.md).

Four roles are for users:

- app-editor
- app-viewer
- app-operator
- service-operator

Two roles are for service accounts associated with the Tanzu Supply Chain:

- workload
- deliverable

The default roles provide an opinionated starting point for the most common permissions that users
need when using Tanzu Application Platform.
However, as described in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
about RBAC, you can create customized roles and permissions that better meet your needs.
Aggregated cluster roles are used to build VMware Tanzu Application Platform default roles.


Cluster admins must be careful when creating Roles or ClusterRoles.
When changing roles or adding new roles that carry one of the labels used by the default roles, the roles are automatically updated to the aggregation state. It can lead to unintentional changes in functions and permissions to all users.


The default roles are installed with every Tanzu Application Platform profile except for `view`.
For an overview of the different roles and their permissions, see [Role Descriptions](role-descriptions.md).

[Tanzu Developer Portal](../tap-gui/about.md) (formerly named Tanzu Application Platform GUI) does
not make use of the described roles. Instead, it provides the user with view access for each cluster.
