The extension makes use of the following files within your project:

- `workload.yaml`
- `catalog-info.yaml`
- `Tiltfile`
- `.tanzuignore`

You can create these files by using the instructions in this topic,
or use the files in the [View an example project](#example-project) section.

There are two ways to create these files:

- Using the code snippets that Tanzu Developer Tools provide, which create templates in empty files
  that you then fill in with the required information.
- Writing the files manually.
