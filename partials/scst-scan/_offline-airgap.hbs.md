The `grype` CLI attempts to perform two over the Internet calls: 

- One to verify for later versions of the CLI.
- One to update the vulnerability database before scanning.

For the `grype` CLI to function in an offline or air-gapped environment, the
vulnerability database must be hosted within the environment. You must configure
the `grype` CLI with the internal URL.

The `grype` CLI accepts environment variables to satisfy these needs.

For information about setting up an offline vulnerability database, see the [Anchore Grype README](https://github.com/anchore/grype#offline-and-air-gapped-environments) in GitHub.

## <a id="enable-grype-airgap"></a> To enable Grype in offline air-gapped environments

1. Add the following to your tap-values.yaml:

    ```yaml
    grype:
      db:
        dbUpdateUrl: INTERNAL-VULN-DB-URL
    ```

    - `INTERNAL-VULN-DB-URL`: URL that points to the internal file server.

2. Update Tanzu Application Platform:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

### ERROR failed to fetch latest cli version

**Note**: This message is a warning and the grype scan still runs with this message.

The Grype CLI checks for later versions of the CLI by contacting the anchore endpoint over the Internet.

```console
ERROR failed to fetch latest version: Get "https://toolbox-data.anchore.io/grype/releases/latest/VERSION": dial tcp: lookup toolbox-data.anchore.io on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:65010->[::1]:53: read: connection refused
```

#### Solution

To deactivate this check, set the environment variable `GRYPE_CHECK_FOR_APP_UPDATE` to `false` by using a package overlay with the following steps:

1. Create a secret that contains the ytt overlay to add the Grype environment variable to the ScanTemplates.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: grype-airgap-deactivate-cli-check-overlay
      namespace: tap-install #! namespace where tap is installed
    stringData:
      patch.yaml: |
        #@ load("@ytt:overlay", "overlay")

        #@overlay/match by=overlay.subset({"kind":"ScanTemplate"}),expects="1+"
        ---
        spec:
          template:
            initContainers:
              #@overlay/match by=overlay.subset({"name": "scan-plugin"}), expects="1+"
              - name: scan-plugin
                #@overlay/match missing_ok=True
                env:
                  #@overlay/append
                  - name: GRYPE_CHECK_FOR_APP_UPDATE
                    value: "false"
    ```

2. Configure tap-values.yaml to use `package_overlays`. Add the following to your tap-values.yaml:

    ```yaml
    package_overlays:
      - name: "grype"
        secrets:
            - name: "grype-airgap-deactivate-cli-check-overlay"
    ```

3. Update Tanzu Application Platform:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

### Database is too old

```console
1 error occurred:
  * db could not be loaded: the vulnerability database was built N days/weeks ago (max allowed age is 5 days)
```

Grype needs up-to-date vulnerability information to provide accurate matches. By
default, it fails to run if the local database was not built in the last 5 days.

#### Solution

Two options to resolve this:

1. Stale databases weaken your security posture. VMware recommends updating the database daily as the first recommended solution.

2. If updating the database daily is not an option, the data staleness check is configurable by using the environment variable
`GRYPE_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_BUILT_AGE` and is addressed using a package overlay with
the following steps:

   1. Create a secret that contains the ytt overlay to add the Grype environment variable to the ScanTemplates.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: grype-airgap-override-stale-db-overlay
      namespace: tap-install #! namespace where tap is installed
    stringData:
      patch.yaml: |
        #@ load("@ytt:overlay", "overlay")

        #@overlay/match by=overlay.subset({"kind":"ScanTemplate"}),expects="1+"
        ---
        spec:
          template:
            initContainers:
              #@overlay/match by=overlay.subset({"name": "scan-plugin"}), expects="1+"
              - name: scan-plugin
                #@overlay/match missing_ok=True
                env:
                  #@overlay/append
                  - name: GRYPE_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_BUILT_AGE #! see note on best practices
                    value: "120h"
    ```

    > **Note** The default maximum allowed built age of Grype's vulnerability
    > database is 5 days. This means that scanning with a 6 day old database
    > causes the scan to fail. You can use the
    > `GRYPE_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_BUILT_AGE` parameter to override the default in
    > accordance with your security posture.

   2. Configure tap-values.yaml to use `package_overlays`. Add the following to your tap-values.yaml:

       ```yaml
       package_overlays:
         - name: "grype"
           secrets:
               - name: "grype-airgap-override-stale-db-overlay"
       ```

   3. Update Tanzu Application Platform:

       ```console
       tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
       ```

### Vulnerability database is invalid

```
scan-pod[scan-plugin]  1 error occurred:
scan-pod[scan-plugin]	* failed to load vulnerability db: vulnerability database is invalid (run db update to correct): database metadata not found: /.cache/grype/db/5
```

#### Solution

Examine the `listing.json` file you previously created. This should match the format of the "listing file" found at [Anchore Grype's public endpoint](https://github.com/anchore/grype#how-database-updates-work).

Here is an example of a properly formatted `listing.json`:

```
{
  "available": {
    "5": [
      {
        "built": "2023-03-28T01:29:38Z",
        "version": 5,
        "url": "https://toolbox-data.anchore.io/grype/databases/vulnerability-db_v5_2023-03-28T01:29:38Z_e49d318c32a6113eed07.tar.gz",
        "checksum": "sha256:408ce2932f04dee929a5df524e92494f2d635c6b19e30ff9f0a50425b1fc29a1"
      },
      .....
    ]
  }
}
```

Where:
- `5` refers to the Grype's vulnerability database schema.
- `built` is the build timestamp in the format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`.
- `url` is the download url for the tarball containing the database. This should point at your internal endpoint. The tarball should contain the following files:
  - ` vulnerability.db` is an SQLite file that is Grype's vulnerability database. Each time the data shape of the vulnerability database changes, a new schema is created thus different Grype versions require specific database schema versions. (For example, Grype `v0.54.0` requires database schema version 5.)
  - `metadata.json` file
- `checksum` is the sha used to verify the database's integrity.

Check these possible reasons for why the vulnerability database may be invalid:

1. The database schema is invalid. First confirm that the required database schema for the installed Grype version is being used. Next, confirm that the top level version key matches the nested `version`. For example, the top level version `1` in the below snippet does not match the nested `version: 5`.
```json
{
  "available": {
    "1": [{
            "built": "2023-02-08T08_17_20Z",
            "version": 5,
            "url": "https://INTERNAL-ENDPOINT/releases/vulnerability-db_v5_2023-02-08T08_17_20Z_6ef73016d160043c630f.tar.gz",
            "checksum": "sha256:aab8d369933c845878ef1b53bb5c26ee49b91ddc5cd87c9eb57ffb203a88a72f"
    }]
  }
}
```
As stale databases weaken your security posture, VMware recommends using the newest entry of the relevant schema version in the `listing.json` file. For more information see Anchoreâ€™s [grype-db](https://github.com/anchore/grype-db).

1. The `built` parameters in the `listing.json` file is incorrectly formatted. The proper format is `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`.

1. The `url` which you modified to point at an internal endpoint is not reachable from within the cluster. Verify connectivity by following below [steps](#debug-grype-database-in-a-cluster)

#### Debug Grype database in a cluster

1. Describe the failed source/image scan to determine the name of the ScanTemplate being used:
```console
kubectl describe sourcescan/imagescan SCAN-NAME -n DEV-NAMESPACE
```

Where `SCAN-NAME` is the name of the source/image scan that failed.

1. Modify the ScanTemplate's `scan-plugin` container to include a "sleep" entrypoint which will allow you to troubleshoot inside the container:
    ```yaml
    - name: scan-plugin
      volumeMounts:
        ...
      image: #@ data.values.scanner.image
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      env:
        ...
      command: ["/bin/bash"]
      args:
      - "sleep 1800" # insert 30 min sleep here
    ```

1. Re-run the scan.

1. Get the name of the `scan-plugin` pod.
    ```console
    kubectl get pods -n DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

1. Get a shell to the container by (see Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/get-shell-running-container/) for more details):
    ```console
    kubectl exec --stdin --tty SCAN-PLUGIN-POD -c step-scan-plugin -- /bin/bash
    ```

    Where `SCAN-PLUGIN-POD` is the name of the `scan-plugin` pod.

1. Inside the container, run Grype CLI commands to report database status and verify connectivity from cluster to mirror. See [here](https://github.com/anchore/grype#cli-commands-for-database-management) for more details.

   * Report current status of Grype's database (location, build date, and checksum):
      ```console
      grype db status
      ```

   * Download the listing file configured at `db.update-url` and show databases that are available for download:
     ```console
     grype db list
     ```
